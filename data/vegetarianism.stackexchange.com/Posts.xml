Vegans can consume fortified soy formulas, soy milk,&#xA;  soy cheese, soy yogurt, and various other calcium-fortified foods.&#xA;  Eating these foods in the age-appropriate amounts will ensure adequate&#xA;  calcium intake (Weaver &amp;amp; Plawecki, 1994). For infants, it is important&#xA;  to note that commercial soy milk should not be introduced before the&#xA;  end of the first year because of the low bioavailability of iron and&#xA;  zinc from soy (Sandstrom, Kivisto, &amp;amp; Cederblad, 1987).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism#Nutrition&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, Calcium can also be found from the following: broccoli, bok choy, and kale:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The calcium found in broccoli, bok choy, and kale have also been found&#xA;  to have calcium that is well absorbed in the body.[86][87][89] Though&#xA;  the calcium content per serving is lower in these vegetables than a&#xA;  glass of milk, the absorption of the calcium into the body is&#xA;  higher.[87][89] Other foods that contain calcium include calcium-set&#xA;  tofu, blackstrap molasses, turnip greens, mustard greens, soybeans,&#xA;  tempeh, almonds, okra, dried figs, and tahini.[86][88] Though calcium&#xA;  can be found in Spinach, swiss chard, beans and beet greens, they are&#xA;  generally not considered to be a good source since the calcium binds&#xA;  to oxalic acid and is poorly absorbed into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, a vegetarian has several sources of obtaining Calcium.

White sugar, as well as brown sugar and confectioner's sugar derived from white sugar, comes into direct contact with the bone carbon throughout the filtration process. The sugar that ends up on grocery store shelves, however, rarely contains bone particles, which Zamojcin says makes it OK for some vegetarians to eat. But strict vegetarians and vegans still say no to refined, white sugar because animals were used in processing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Words to look out for&lt;/strong&gt;: There's usually one ingredient listed on a bag of sugar: &quot;sugar.&quot; So to know for sure if your sugar is processed with a bone char you'll have to ask the manufacturer.

If I ate with one of my vegan friends, I would order what they ordered at most restaurants and sometimes let them take me to a vegan one. I figured out how to assemble a proteinilicious meal using beans and grains long prior to my switch. I knew vitamins B12 and D were the risky ones although regrettably I became deficient in both (tip: take huge doses of each).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is also critically important empathy when working with friends who sort of seem like they might want to become vegan, but don't; though tangential I will share it here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So as someone who is vegan on ethical grounds it’s tempting to be smug about it. But that misses the tremendous amount of work that went into switching to plant-based food as a step in the process of knowing plant-based food.

So if we assumed that was all red meat and replaced it with chicken, we are going from 5,670 miles/year to 1,440 miles/year. So &lt;strong&gt;switching red meat for chicken is approximately equivalent to a 4,230-mile reduction in driving&lt;/strong&gt; (in terms of carbon footprint). The reduction of going from red meat to chicken is huge in comparison from going from chicken to vegan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The average car owner drives about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;16,500 miles per year&lt;/a&gt;.

Of course, if you eat more meat or drive less it could very easily have a greater impact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that carbon footprint isn't the only form of environmental impact. These calculations are only for carbon. Both driving and eating meat have other effects on the environment.

Also ingredients ratio are different: depends on fat concentration of the coconut oil you use, check the % in weight which is fat and use that to compute a new dose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Usually butter have 80% fat. &lt;strong&gt;A simple computation&lt;/strong&gt;, assume your coconut oil have 70% and in your recipe you were using 200gr of butter,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;then you need:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(1,8/1,7) * 200 = 211 gr of oil&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course keep in mind that the lesser the fat in the oil, the more you may need, and eventually some fatty ingredients may have a too low concentration of fat for whipping to happens ( the % of ingredient that is not fatty actually prevents whipping).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="125" LastEditorUserId="125" LastEditDate="2017-02-01T13:54:57.920" LastActivityDate="2017-02-01T13:54:57.920" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Many low-income countries have far lower meat in their diet than developed countries. Many people on student budgets also reduce their meat intake for financial reasons.

Your body is programmed to require a certain level of protein and fat. If you don't eat sufficient amounts, your body will attempt to synthesise them from what nutrients you do have.

Although most of my shopping consisted of regular supermarket groceries, I believe this would still be true if I was regularly buying organic products. Meat, along with cheese, were the most expensive items on my shopping list. After the transition, the only thing comparably expensive are nuts, but I did not buy them as often as meat or cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/strong&gt; this is (for me) somewhat less true. It all depends on where you buy things and what are your eating habits, of course, but with the plethora of substitutes to choose from and their current &quot;specialty&quot; status, the difference can be much less visible. While living here, I got used to eating a lot of Quorn products, as well as some of the Tesco's own veggie brand. Since living here, I also became vegan and while Alpro milks can be found for reasonable prices, they are still 2-3 times more expensive per litre than regular milk. Vegetables and fruits are also more expensive here (again, it depends where you shop, Aldi and Lidl use to have some really good offers). Another thing that levels these two diets are the ubiquitous &quot;junky&quot; foods like burgers-to-go etc. and these are being sold rather cheaply. Considering &lt;strong&gt;my style of living&lt;/strong&gt;, I would say it is actually &lt;strong&gt;slightly more expensive&lt;/strong&gt; to be vegetarian/vegan here, but the benefits outweigh perceived costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To conclude - and I believe this will be true regardless of the country you live in - &lt;strong&gt;it all breaks down to what your eating habits are&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;what requirements you have&lt;/strong&gt; regarding the freshness, origin and nutritional value of your food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="164" LastActivityDate="2017-02-01T14:42:15.623" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

By eating raw potatoes, green bananas or uncooked plantains, large amounts of indigestible starches pass through the small intestine almost intact. When they reach the large intestine, colon bacteria feed on it producing gas. This causes abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, flatulence and cramps.&#xA;  Cooking potatoes and plantains and ripening bananas breaks down the cellular walls of these resistant starches, making them digestible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;contamination of bacteria present in the soil,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Bacteria such as Listeria, E. coli and Salmonella are found in water and soil.

You can also include grounding, nutritive snacks in between&#xA;  meals. For instance, fill a jar with dates, pour warm&#xA;  Ghee (clarified butter) over them and let the ghee solidify. Eat one or two of these ghee&#xA;  dates in the early morning or any time between meals for a&#xA;  rejuvenative boost of energy. Other supportive snacks include soaked&#xA;  and peeled almonds, soaked cashews, and date shakes.&#xA;  Experiment with what works for you and keep snacks handy so that you&#xA;  can reach for quality nourishment rather than a quick fix of empty&#xA;  energy (i.e., sugar or junk food).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/living-ayurveda/diet/vata-pacifying-foods&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; gives a list of fruit, vegetables, grains, legumes etc to be preferred and avoided for weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="162" LastActivityDate="2017-02-01T16:15:46.320" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I will state the sources of these sources in small under the quotes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we look to the available land, a non-vegetarian uses approximately six times as much land as a vegetarian and 18 times as much as a vegan. &lt;sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Robbins, John. Diet for a New America, StillPoint Publishing, 1987, p. 352 &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if everyone goes vegetarian, we can feed almost six times as much people, if everyone goes vegan, almost 18 times as much. Note that land is actually a limiting factor for food production. In fact, it is the main reason that forests are cut is making more land for food (mainly meat and food for animals) production (&quot;Animal agriculture is responsible for up to 91% of Amazon destruction&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: The actual figures are a bit lower since there are already some people vegetarian or vegan, but, unfortunately, that is not enough to make a really significant difference in these 6 and 18. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some other factors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Each day, a person who eats a vegan diet saves 1,100 gallons of water, 45 pounds of grain, 30 sq ft of forested land, 20 lbs CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent, and one animal’s life.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;   &lt;sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;   –“Water Footprint Assessment.” University of Twente, the Netherlands. &lt;br&gt; “Measuring the daily destruction of the world’s rainforests.” Scientific American, 2009. &lt;br&gt; “Dietary greenhouse gas emissions of meat-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans in the UK.” Climactic change, 2014. &lt;br&gt; “Meat eater’s guide to climate change and health.” The Environmental Working Group. &lt;br&gt;  Oppenlander, Richard A.

Print.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/usda/whole-grain-wheat-flour?portionid=48559&amp;amp;portionamount=1.300&quot;&gt;fatsecret&lt;/a&gt;, 1.3 lbs of flour (this is approximately 1.3 lbs of grain) can feed a person for a day, so  45 pounds of grain can feed 45/1.3 = 34 persons a day. When looking to water, the difference is even greater. 10 gallons of water would be more than enough for a person to drink from and have some personal hygiene (people in wealthy countries use more, but this is what should be more than enough to live), so that would be 110 extra  people that would have access to enough water to lvie from. (Note that this is vegan instead of vegetarian. A vegan livestyle saves even more than a vegetarian, so for a vegetarian it will be a bit less.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other shocking quotes form this source:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We are currently growing enough food to feed 10 billion people.

Hence omega 3 intakes are obviously different according to diet:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;While intakes of the omega-3 fatty acid -linolenic acid (ALA) are similar in vegetarians and non-vegetarians, intakes of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are low in vegetarians and virtually absent in vegans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mja.com.au/open/2012/1/2/omega-3-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-and-vegetarian-diets&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;(Saunders 2012)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However our body can convert ALA into EPA and DHA.

If intervention studies were to confirm these findings, it could have implications for fish requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/92/5/1040.short&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;(Welch 2010)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In less technical language, the researchers found that vegetarians and vegans were eating less EPA and DHA. However ALA, EPA and DHA blood levels were similar for the three diet groups (&lt;em&gt;omnivorous, vegetarians, vegans&lt;/em&gt;). This is somewhat surprising since common scientific literature -quoted in the same article- says that conversion rate from ALA into EPA and DHA are quite low. The same researchers suggested that vegetarians and vegans are more capable of converting ALA into other omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the &lt;strong&gt;stability of blood omega-3 levels,&lt;/strong&gt; another study worth citing states:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The proportions of plasma long-chain n−3 fatty acids were not significantly affected by the duration of adherence to a vegetarian or vegan diet.

I would argue that because of each one of these things: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animal cruelty:&lt;/strong&gt; To satisfy the demand of our booming population, milk industry is far far away from where it was just a few centuries ago. Milk, primarily intended for calves, is being harvested by machines in an infinite loop to be drunk by humans. Male cows are redundant and therefore eaten/killed. Normal bonds between calves and cows are destroyed for the sake of production. Not speaking of less than ideal living conditions in many cases. As any other animal we use, cows are being exploited terribly and, literally, treated as pieces of dead meat, not living beings. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animal product:&lt;/strong&gt; As such, milk from cows (or any other animal, for that matter), is not made for us. It has its own primary recipients and there are some clues about them being &lt;a href=&quot;http://sciencenordic.com/calves-aren%E2%80%99t-being-given-enough-milk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;rather underfed&lt;/a&gt;. When left to fed as they please, calves drank two to three times the amount that is recommended (and widely administered to them) by industry. We are actually stealing it and other than the taste and our convenience, there is no real reason for us to do so. We do not need it to survive and I believe that our consumption of it is not seen as perverse only because of how deeply ingrained it is in our culture. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something else:&lt;/strong&gt; Here I would mention &lt;strong&gt;ecological impact&lt;/strong&gt; of dairy industry for which rain forests and other biotops are being destroyed, mainly for producing food for cows. For various reasons, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;water cost per litre of milk&lt;/a&gt; can be as high as &lt;strong&gt;1,200 litres of water&lt;/strong&gt;. With the population of about &lt;strong&gt;1.3 billion&lt;/strong&gt;, large quantity of which is bred for the dairy industry, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass_(ecology)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;combined biomass of cattle&lt;/a&gt; is roughly 520 million tonnes (this is rather conservative estimate based on average cow size of 400kg). There is no other big animal on this planet with bigger biomass. And it is anything, but natural. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the other hand, there is human breastfeeding.&lt;/strong&gt; Milk which is produced &lt;strong&gt;precisely for humans&lt;/strong&gt;. It has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_milk#Comparison_to_other_milks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;different nutritional composition&lt;/a&gt; compared to other milks, eg. is much lower in casein. It targets the needs of the human baby by design and the act of feeding the baby serves as one of the early life bonding moments for the mother and the child. There is also the immunological aspect of breastfeeding, because numerous studies show passive, long-term benefits with regards to immunity. This is also one of the reasons for which brestfeeding is preferred over infant milk substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To put things into perspective, there is no added animal cruelty or ecological impact of human breastfeeding. It is the most natural way of feeding human infants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not about things being or not being &lt;em&gt;called&lt;/em&gt; milk. Word milk is but a label which we use to abstract rather large group of things with similiar properties. While this labeling may add to the confusion, milk from other animals and human milk are inherently different. &lt;strong&gt;There is no single reason for vegans to even consider not to breastfeed because of their diet.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the purposes of this answer, I assumed that by milk is meant the most produced type of milk which is cow's.

Furthermore, it is expected that the actively farmed area &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_conversion_ratio&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;will go down 2 to 7 times&lt;/a&gt; or so and either reclaimed by forest or left to rest and recover some top soil. More forest means better local climate (big forests create their own micro-climate) as well as global climate. More rested land and healthy top soil means better yields and less need to fertilizers, which means less water pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;strong&gt;distribution&lt;/strong&gt; because meat is more densely packed in caloric terms it may seem that we spend more in carrying around water-filled vegetables. However, a switch to vegan means we can reclaim our cities landscapes and buy more from local and regional grown vegetables. Also, if not eating grass, animals will be given feed that had to be transported to the animal farm somehow. Even if the food source is close to the animal farm, there is still some distribution distance added to the delivery of the meat itself. All in all, there is great potential for a simplification of the distribution network if more people can grow/buy their food close to home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't see much difference in how the food will be sold, since as of today there are already many fresh traditional markets that deal almost exclusively with vegetables and fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vitamins supplements will continue to raise in popularity.

A large proportion of &lt;strong&gt;deforestation&lt;/strong&gt; in recent years has been caused by the expansion of oil palm fields, partly provoked by the demand for biofuels. So, boycotting palm oil is a way to reduce or express resistance to &lt;strong&gt;destruction of the environment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, there was a campaign by Rainforest Action Network.

So avoiding palm oil may theoretically help to &lt;strong&gt;save animals' lives&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We should note that orangutans are not the only victims of deforestation, since eliminating forest causes the death of thousands species and the loss of biodiversity. It's understandable that RAN focused on one species to create a more emotionally provocative, impactful campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, palm oil contains about 50% &lt;strong&gt;saturated fats&lt;/strong&gt;, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases when consumed.

At first sight these appear very different, but I believe they have common issues. Here I will only deal with hilltop areas in temperate zones as I have knowledge about it. I hope other answers can discuss different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Hilltop areas in temperate zones&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will use my native land as an example here. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monbiot.com/2017/01/04/the-hills-are-dead/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;As pointed out in this&lt;/a&gt; and other articles by George Monbiot, land used for grazing on hilltops would naturally be forested in temperate areas:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Britain, strangely, the lowlands are largely bare and the uplands&#xA;are even barer. This is not a natural condition. In Norway, at the&#xA;same latitudes as northern Scotland, in similar climatic conditions,&#xA;trees cover the high mountainsides[3]. The uplands of Britain would&#xA;once have been largely forested. But, aside from plantations of exotic&#xA;conifers, there are few trees in this country above 200m.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our bare hills are an artefact of three principal activities: sheep&#xA;farming, deer stalking and grouse shooting. Sheep and deer selectively&#xA;browse out tree seedlings, ensuring that existing forests cannot&#xA;regenerate and trees cannot repopulate bare land.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sheep are a fully automated system for environmental destruction. Once&#xA;they are released into the hills, no further human agency is required&#xA;to prevent ecological recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the rich soil of the lowlands is excellent for cultivation of food crops, the highlands have poor soil which can support trees, but is not suitable for profitable crop cultivation. It is important to note that sheep farming on this land is also very unprofitable and in my country is very heavily subsidised:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without farm subsidies, there would be scarcely any hill farming in&#xA;Europe: the activity is uneconomic almost everywhere and will remain&#xA;so under all conceivable market conditions, as a result of poor soils&#xA;and harsh climate. Anyone who wishes to farm there must rely on&#xA;subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The loss of trees causes soil erosion from the hills and significantly increases the risk of flash flooding and drought in the lowlands. Trees and woodland retain water and soil and regulate the water cycle, thus protecting fertile lowlands and their crops from flood (which may catastrophically remove soil into water courses and the sea) and drought.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, &lt;strong&gt;the best way to use former grazing lands to increase food production may well be to simply allow natural forest growth&lt;/strong&gt; whether or not the soil is too poor to support sustainable cultivation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of allowing natural forest growth extend beyond food production; it also protects settlements from flooding, regulates the water table (for drinking and other uses), and provides habitats to support biodiversity (which creates an exciting lovely world to live in for humans, if you need a justification on that basis - I think biodiversity is an end in itself). It may well be possible to introduce crops that can tolerate poor soil, exposed conditions, relative drought and so on that could be grown profitably on hilltops, or to use artificial techniques to fertilise the soil, but taking a holistic, long term view, allowing natural forest would be more sustainable and beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="74" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-18T08:37:18.697" LastActivityDate="2017-02-04T10:11:29.927" CommentCount="5" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

B12 supplementation is usually advised based on monitoring levels in the blood rather than your demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B12 is a stored vitamin so it may take a long time (months to years) to develop a deficiency. Therefore you are advised to take more than your body needs to restore these stores of B12 and monitor whether your B12 levels pick up with regular blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another consideration is that B12 is poorly absorbed if taken orally. While the standard daily dose is 50μg (micrograms), only a fraction of that is absorbed. The daily intake varies (higher for pregnant or breastfeeding females) but is between 2-3μg for all adults and these supplements should be sufficient to absorb enough B12 if you have a marginal deficiency. While B12 overdose is rare, doctors advise against taking more than the standard 50μg dose as more than that is not necessary (mainly due to cost concerns rather than overdose). 50μg is the dose offered by several supplement companies (here in NZ) and higher doses for &quot;energy&quot; or &quot;natural alternatives&quot; are not recommended by doctors (as there is no evidence that they are beneficial).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option is injections of B12. Some people have issues absorbing this vitamin so it is recommended if B12 levels aren't restored by oral supplements or if patients have severe deficiency at diagnosis. Since it is a stored vitamin these injections may be given weeks or months apart (depends on your blood levels). This has more risks of overdose but is still widely regarded to be safe and is done routinely for patients with a variety of conditions (including Chronic Fatigue Syndrome). These injections are 1000μg (weekly) or 5000μg (3-4 weeks) at most. Note that while these are higher doses, the average daily intake is only marginally higher than oral supplements and these are intended to &lt;em&gt;restore vitamin stores&lt;/em&gt; in deficient individuals rather than meet a daily need in those absorbing it regularly in the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="159" LastEditorUserId="1236" LastEditDate="2018-05-09T15:32:35.180" LastActivityDate="2018-05-09T15:32:35.180" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

While food produced with pesticides kills animals in the process, it usually doesn't &lt;em&gt;contain&lt;/em&gt; animal parts (in contrast to organic food, which may contain the odd bug or two), and would be considered vegan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Vegan ethics &amp;amp; pesticide&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, many vegans choose their consumption style based on ethics (be it related to the environment or animal welfare), and won't support food produced with big amounts of pesticide (i.e. most conventionally produced food). Others may choose to be vegan based on health or taste reasons, and they wouldn't bother (except because of health concerns related to pesticides).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How unethical is pesticide use from the viewpoint of an ethically motivated vegan? Quite unethical, since not only many insects suffer and die, but also many insect-feeding animals  are deprived of their original habitat (due to lack of their natural food sources), or are poisoned when eating insects that were poisoned with pesticides in the first place (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;bioaccumulation&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pesticides are also harmful for humans. They pollute the ground water, and many of them are poisonous to humans. Millions of people working in agriculture, especially in the developing countries, are poisoned by pesticides in their lives, and thousands die.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Organic farming&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How much better is organic farming in this respect? Considerably better, but still animals will suffer and die. Most organic regulations still allows some types of &amp;quot;organic&amp;quot; pesticides, and organic factory farming exists and makes use of them. Harvesting involves lots of mechanical processes that kill animals, ploughing kills animals, and so on. Farming in general sculpts the land and changes the habitat type. Where do we want to stop, then? Building a house kills animals. Drilling a tunnel kills moles. Driving your electric emission-free Tesla kills animals on the road. Walking kills insects. You have to make your personal choice at some point on how much impact you want to accept for yourself, and go with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally have made my peace with &lt;em&gt;organic vegan food&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. without pesticides and synthetic or animal-based fertiliser). In German, the term &amp;quot;biovegan&amp;quot; is on the rise for this concept. I understand that I have some negative impact on the world just by continuing to live, and I find the amount that comes from my food consumption, acceptable. There are organic farms that don't use animal based fertilisers (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/questions/292/can-a-modern-diet-be-vegan-organic-and-sustainable/310#310&quot;&gt;Can a modern diet be vegan, organic and sustainable?&lt;/a&gt;), and I buy from them. The farm makes for a better wildlife habitat than monocultures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Invertebrates vs. vertebrates - is it bugging you?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing anyone needs to find out for themselves is how much compassion one wants to bring towards insects and other invertebrates.

Humans and apes are&#xA;  remarkably similar biologically. In the wild, apes and monkeys consume&#xA;  diets composed largely of plant foods, primarily the fruits and leaves&#xA;  of tropical forest trees and vines. Considerable evidence indicates&#xA;  that the ancestral line giving rise to humans (Homo spp.) was likewise&#xA;  &lt;strong&gt;strongly herbivorous&lt;/strong&gt; (plant-eating).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1095643303000849&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;(Milton 2003)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nutritionjrnl.com/article/S0899-9007(99)00078-7/abstract&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; the same researcher lists more details about the diets of wild anthropoids, resuming:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;both monkeys and apes feed &lt;strong&gt;primarily on plant foods, eating moderate&#xA;  to trace amounts of animal source foods&lt;/strong&gt; (ASF), generally  insects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We might so summarize that &lt;strong&gt;humans are predisposed to a diet strongly based on plant foods&lt;/strong&gt;, being able to process and digest only small amounts of animal source foods. (&lt;em&gt;We might also talk about ethics and human ability to choose, but this would be off-topic here.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also interesting to have a look at other considerations about present diet: the &lt;strong&gt;foods we eat today are very different frome the ones we ate in the past&lt;/strong&gt;. In the brilliant article &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/81/2/341.full&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Origins and evolution of the Western diet: health implications for the 21st century&lt;/a&gt;&quot; Cordain &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; analyze the changes that happened in foods and diet in only 150 years:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;food staples and food-processing procedures introduced during the&#xA;  Neolithic and Industrial Periods have fundamentally altered 7 crucial&#xA;  nutritional characteristics of ancestral hominin diets: 1) glycemic&#xA;  load, 2) fatty acid composition, 3) macronutrient composition, 4)&#xA;  micronutrient density, 5) acid-base balance, 6) sodium-potassium&#xA;  ratio, and 7) fiber content. The evolutionary collision of our ancient&#xA;  genome with the nutritional qualities of recently introduced foods may&#xA;  underlie many of the chronic diseases of Western civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While points 3 to 7 address to give value to &lt;strong&gt;plant-based diet&lt;/strong&gt; - while not excluding the presence of small amounts of animal source foods - it's the second point, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;fatty acid composition&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, that raises more interest and concern about the choice of consuming meat:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The dominant (&gt;50% fat energy) fatty acids in the fat storage depots&#xA;  (adipocytes) of wild mammals are saturated fatty acids (SFAs), whereas&#xA;  the dominant fatty acids in muscle and all other organ tissues are&#xA;  polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids&#xA;  (MUFAs) (11). Because subcutaneous and abdominal body fat stores are&#xA;  depleted during most of the year in wild animals, PUFAs and MUFAs&#xA;  ordinarily constitute most of the total carcass fat (11).Because of&#xA;  the seasonal cyclic depletion of SFAs and enrichment of PUFAs and&#xA;  MUFAs, a year-round dietary intake of high amounts of SFAs would have&#xA;  not been possible for preagricultural hominins preying on wild&#xA;  mammals. Even with selective butchering by hominins, in which much of&#xA;  the lean muscle meat is discarded, MUFAs and PUFAs constitute the&#xA;  greatest percentage (&gt;50% of energy as fat) of edible fatty acids in&#xA;  the carcass of wild mammals throughout most of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words domesticated animals (and even more the industrially-raised ones) are &lt;strong&gt;much more rich in saturated fats than wild ancestors&lt;/strong&gt;, thus suggesting they're unfit for human consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We might also analyze more in depth wether the conditions where the animals are raised (use of antibiotics, growth-hormones, etc.) make them suitable for consumption but this goes far beyond the scope of your question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="115" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T13:01:23.880" LastActivityDate="2017-02-05T17:37:58.993" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Since only around 10% of the energy input (the percentage used for growth) at one trophic level of a food chain can be passed onto the next, it is more efficient to have a shorter food chain. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means that, generally speaking, you need a lot more crops to feed to animals to feed to people than you need crops to feed to people directly, so raising animals is far less efficient in terms of producing energy per unit of land than raising crops, thinking purely about feeding humans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes argued that animals can be allowed to graze on land that is too poor for crop-raising, and to some extent this is true, and complicates the picture. Animals may also be fed on kitchen waste products and other energy sources that are not considered fit for human consumption, and may or may not overlap with human food sources or the capacity of land to produce them. However, while I do not have accurate statistics to hand, I believe the principle holds generally. [citation needed]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where forest is cleared for agricultural purposes then, larger land areas will be needed to produce the same amount of food (in terms of energy) by livestock raising than for crop raising. Rainforest land is cleared to grow soya, and vegans are often reminded of our complicity in this: we eat soya, so we are contributing to deforestation. However, the great majority of this soya is produced to feed animals who will be killed for their meat. [citation needed]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would argue however that forest should not be cleared for either purpose. There should certainly be enough arable land to feed everyone already without deforestation. Large areas of farmland are not used, or are used to grow biofuel crops, or are used inefficiently, for complex, bad economic reasons (corporate landowners exploiting regulations, food speculation and other globalisation factors)[explanation needed]. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Forests regulate rainfall and water tables, and thus exercise protective effects on agricultural lands in the same geographic area. In former rainforest areas, the soil may be too poor to support nutrient removal via crop growing, and loss of the water retained by forest means that land will be too dry. In the long term, at least in tropical areas, it is more economic to leave forests intact and harvest food products such as roots and fruits from them, because of the rapid soil erosion that occurs, making the land unusable after a few crop cycles.

As Zanna explained the latter very well, and my experience is with the former, I'll focus on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a political economist, I'd say deforestation isn't implemented specifically for either crop or husbandry, but rather for whatever is the most lucrative option in that particular time and place. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that at every scale, international markets as well as domestic (and even insular markets like Cuba!) are currently flooded with cheap, low-quality meat, most new fields are destined for always-in-demand cash-crops such as soy (South America for China); corn (North America for US); poppy (Afghanistan for Russia); fruits, coca, &amp;amp; cannabis (South/Central America for US). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would likely change if: demand shifted to ethically-raised meats, or US laws were to ban factory-raised meat; if demand for cocaine, opium/heroin, or marijuana were to diminish; if another crop became lucrative; if the US stopped putting corn syrup in everything; if Monsanto were to get sucked into a black hole; or if war, natural disaster, or genocide were to wipe out or otherwise engage a big chunk of the world population.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cost-benefit analyses have to include factors such as cost to produce, tariffs and taxes, and the international market for the product. You also have to consider the suitability of the species to the environment, and how you're going to need to compensate for the inevitable differences. Of course, raising factory meat that's never seen the light of day is always going to be much cheaper than grass-feeding, and the same goes (on a much smaller scale) for the greenhouse or indoor herb production that's taking off in urban areas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Example 1: Argentina, an agrarian nation traditionally producing major quantities of both beef and grain for Europe and the US, now bases most of its production on soy for the Chinese market. Deforestation there seems to mostly go towards soy fields now, where before it could go either way.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iasp-pain.org/Taxonomy#Pain&quot;&gt;definition of pain&lt;/a&gt; from the International Association for the Study of Pain is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is, pain implies actual suffering. On the other hand, 'automatic instinct' in which an organism reacts to negative stimuli but does not necessarily feel any associated emotions is called nociception. Even single-celled organisms can display nociception.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The position of the article is that yes, birds feel pain, there's plenty of evidence indicating such (the article has 40 references), it's clear that they mean pain in the sense defined above, and they go on to describe how said pain should be treated. Here are some notable quotes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It is generally accepted that birds perceive pain similarly to mammals. Birds have neurologic components to respond to painful stimuli&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;it is advisable to treat for pain when dealing with any condition expected to cause pain, especially if known to be painful in humans&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Although it is unclear at this time at what taxonomic level nociception is associated with pain and whether all species, including humans, feel pain with the same qualities and intensities, operationally, vertebrates and some invertebrates feel pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Unquestionably, the experience of pain must be aversive and unpleasant to motivate a bird or any other animal to change its behavior. In plain language, pain hurts regardless of the species.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Pain is an individual sensory and emotional experience&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;just because an animal (or a bird in the case of this review) may have a different pain experience from that of humans does not mean that the animal's pain does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More details can be found in the 'Evaluating Pain and Pain-Associated Behavior' section.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It goes beyond pain though.

Most notably &lt;strong&gt;Soy&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;complete protein&lt;/em&gt; with high levels of Methionine so Soymilk, Tofu, Edamame, and Natto are all good protein sources. Similarly, &lt;strong&gt;Chickpeas&lt;/strong&gt; (garbanzo) are higher in Lysine than most beans, while not complete for essential amino acids there easier to complement. Not strictly beans but &lt;em&gt;Quinoa&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Buckwheat&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Quorn&lt;/em&gt; are all complete protein sources too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another consideration is that Methionine and Lysine are plentiful in other foods and easy to complement. Eating beans with Rice, Wheat, or Couscous would get you your full set of amino acids in one meal. Note that &lt;em&gt;Corn is also Lysine deficient&lt;/em&gt; which is a problem in some diets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best approach to complete proteins is variety, then you ensure you get a variety of other nutrients (vitamins, minerals), and get to eat interesting things instead of the same thing everyday. Soy has become the &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; vegetarian protein substitute for good reasons but a health diet is a balanced one and there's no reason not to give other beans a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="159" LastEditorUserId="159" LastEditDate="2018-05-17T08:27:02.090" LastActivityDate="2018-05-17T08:27:02.090" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

While most condoms are made from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywell.com/latex-condoms-906784&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;rubber latex&lt;/a&gt;, condoms made from lamb cecums are also available. These are called lamb-skin condoms or just skin condoms in short. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quoting from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.madehow.com/Volume-2/Condom.html#ixzz4Yiqm0yKn&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term condom is actually a corruption of the name of an 18th-century British physician, Dr. John Conton, who provided condoms to France's King Charles II. The legendary lover Giovanni Casanova (1725-1798) used &lt;strong&gt;pieces of sheep intestine&lt;/strong&gt; to protect himself against venereal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The first condom manufacturer in the U.S. was Schmid Laboratories. In 1883, Julius Schmid, a former sausage skin-maker, acquired a business that manufactured bottle seals from animal membranes. Five years later, &lt;strong&gt;Schmid used his experience with sausage casings and capping skins to manufacture prophylactic sheaths from lamb cecum&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raw materials:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing process remains relatively unchanged since Schmid first manufactured condoms : the cecums are washed, defatted, and salted. The raw skins are then shipped to the finishing plants. New Zealand, which raises large numbers of sheep, is the primary source and initial processing center for most &quot;skin&quot; condoms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The testing of these does not involve any animal products or animal cruelty..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a curing period of several days, the condoms are sampled by batch and tested for leaks and strength. The first such test is the inflation test, in which the condom is filled with air until it bursts. Condoms are required to stretch beyond 1.5 cubic feet, about the size of a watermelon, before bursting. This test is considered most important because the elasticity of the condom keeps it from tearing during inter-course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the water-leakage test, the condom is filled with 10 ounces (300 ml) of water and inspected for pin-sized holes by rolling it along blotter paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Condoms are also tested electronically. This involves mounting each condom on a charged stainless steel mandrel. The mandrel is passed over by a soft, conductive brush. If pin holes are present, a circuit will be established with the mandrel, and the machine will automatically reject the condom.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the raw materials used in manufacture involves animal products, it is non-vegan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To differentiate between skin condoms and latex condoms, there is a sign. &#xA;Latex condoms have a green dot on the package. On skin condoms, it is replaced by a brown dot &lt;a href=&quot;http://foodsafetyhelpline.com/2013/10/declaration-of-vegnon-veg-module-5/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;(at least in India)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/leNSom.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/leNSom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;green and brown dots&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now. What's the problem with Latex condoms?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most condoms are made from latex. In order to make latex smooth, most manufacturers use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casein&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;casein&lt;/a&gt; – a milk derivative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; — in the latex manufacturing process.

It is intended to express the fact that no animals have been harmed in making the item; it does not contain animal products, and has not been tested on animals. This would have the same meaning as &quot;vegan&quot; in this context. Occasionally, the term may also be used on food products and in restaurants, usually alongside the word &quot;vegan&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, while interpretations and opinions vary, &quot;vegan&quot; is a fairly well-defined term in my country, and The Vegan Society, to name one key organisation, produces reference materials and gives guidance on what is and is not considered to be vegan. If you find a product containing honey that the manufacturer claims is vegan, you can call them to account with the backing of the Vegan Society, documetation in hand. There is no such definition or documentation for &quot;cruelty-free&quot;, so you had better trust the person who uses the term, and if you don't, ask if it's &quot;vegan&quot; for a less ambiguous answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at it from another perspective, I think there is an intent behind the use of the phrase &quot;cruelty-free&quot; that is less applicable to the term &quot;vegan&quot;. To say that something involves &quot;cruelty&quot; is an explicit moral judgement on the maker of the product (or supplier of the service, perhaps). Thus, If &quot;cruelty-free&quot; is used, it suggests the person promoting the product as such is trying to make an emotional connection with the buyer on the basis of shared values, genuinely or not. &quot;Vegan&quot; is also a term with ethical underpinnings, but if it can be taken to imply judgement, it is far more implicit and subtle than &quot;cruelty free&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="74" LastActivityDate="2017-02-15T08:05:28.367" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Concentrating a large amount of a chemical into a small pill makes it hard for the body to absorb it properly before it passes through. This effect gets worse as the dose increases, which means it gets even worse as it is compensated for. It's not impossible to overcome, but the result is that in order to get enough of the vitamin, you do need to ingest much more. So to get the RDA of about 3 µg in a single pill you need to take somewhere around 25 µg, and to get 7 days' worth in one go you need much more than 7 times that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the amounts above are for people who simply want to maintain a healthy level of B12.

If I find research into the protein composition of organic versus conventional wheat, I will add them here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gluten-free seems to be one of the most confused and confusing trends in modern food culture. I am frequently asked if, as a vegan, I can eat bread, since it contains gluten, and I am frequently told, when I ask if a product is vegan &quot;yes, it's completely gluten-free&quot;. I have read several confusing articles saying that coeliac disease is on the rise because of all the starch we eat, &quot;our ancestors didn't eat all these refined starches&quot; etc, although coeliac disease is caused by proteins. I very much hope that research will conclusively explain what is causing gluten sensitivity to increase and thus how we can reverse this rise. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, my conclusion is that seitan itself is not what should be avoided (based on its long history of apparently safe consumption); if anything, it's particular types of wheat eaten in excess. It &lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt; be better to choose organic wheat, which may have lower levels of inflammatory gliadins due to non-application of fertilisers, or to choose &quot;heritage&quot; varieties like spelt which seem to be less inflammatory. Further research is needed, but, it seems, seitan is not the enemy here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Of course, if you are a coeliac or have another type of gluten intolerance, you must avoid seitan along with all foods containing gluten&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="74" LastEditorUserId="74" LastEditDate="2017-08-03T17:01:11.517" LastActivityDate="2017-08-03T17:01:11.517" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Why then do we make an almost total distinction morally? If all organisms are on one physical continuum, then we should also be on the same moral continuum.&amp;quot; He wrote that, at that time in the UK, 5,000,000 animals were being used each year in experiments, and that attempting to gain benefits for our own species through the mistreatment of others was &amp;quot;just 'speciesism' and as such it is a selfish emotional argument rather than a reasoned one.&amp;quot; Ryder used the term again in an essay, &amp;quot;Experiments on Animals,&amp;quot; in Animals, Men and Morals (1971), a collection of essays on animal rights edited by philosophy graduate students Stanley and Roslind Godlovitch and John Harris, who were also members of the Oxford Group&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Original references:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ryder, Richard D.

He started deploying this process in the year 1992 and has hence been supported by a larger community of people interested in the welfare and rights of animals and non-humans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process of producing silk in this process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The process of creating silk humanely begins in one of two ways: either the pupa is allowed to hatch and the leftover cocoon is then used to create silk, or the cocoon may be cut open, achieving much the same result but often saving the resultant material from contamination by urine from the hatching moth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With ahimsa silk, however, cocoons are left alone for seven to 10 days. Once the worms mature, they are allowed to pierce the cocoons and fly away as moths. Only then does the manufacture of peace silk begin. Each cocoon is checked individually to ensure that the moth has escaped before the silk thread is spun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spinning takes around two months and weaving another month. In other words, shipments can be ready three months after the moths escape. We can produce up to 2,000 meters per month. Ahimsa silk is promoted as having the popular properties of regular silk. Even though it is slightly less lustrous, it is even softer to the touch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ahimsa silk fabric is a bit expensive than normal produced fabric.

The important thing to keep in mind is that &lt;strong&gt;there is good and bad cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt; and different types of saturated fats increase different types of cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;strong&gt;palm oil&lt;/strong&gt; is pretty high in not so good Palmitic acid, it also contains high values of Lauric acid which somehow negates these effects (presumably).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the &lt;strong&gt;coconut oil&lt;/strong&gt;, while it has high content of saturated fats, &lt;strong&gt;majority of these are the good kind&lt;/strong&gt;, with relatively small amounts of Palmitic acid and 18% proportion to the total fat conent of Myristic acid which is, along with Palmitic acid, linked to the increased risk for cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to other &lt;strong&gt;vegetable sources of saturated fats&lt;/strong&gt;, these all have just small amounts of saturated fats in their total fat content and are henceforth less harmful than animal products which contain more of these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Therefore &lt;strong&gt;it can be argued that in fact, all of the vegetable sources of saturated fats are less harmful than their animal counterparts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; As requested by the OP in the comments, I will explain the sources for these claims in a little bit more detail:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To cite from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freezepage.com/1348239076FHWAJDADVT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;previously included source&lt;/a&gt; at page 82 (the hihglight is mine):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between dietary fats and CVD, especially coronary&#xA;heart disease, has been extensively investigated, with strong and&#xA;consistent associations emerging from a wide body of evidence accrued&#xA;from &lt;strong&gt;animal experiments&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as &lt;strong&gt;observational studies, clinical&#xA;trials&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;metabolic studies&lt;/strong&gt; conducted in diverse human populations&#xA;(2).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturated fatty acids raise total and low-density lipoprotein&#xA;(LDL) cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt;, but individual fatty acids within this group, have&#xA;different effects (3--5).

Where I live (Romania, developing country within Eastern Europe), it's the same: soy milk is (much) more expensive than cow's milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The price difference has many causes. To name a few:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;subsidies from the government&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;organic farming is usually done on a smaller scale, leading to a smaller volume of obtained food&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;production cost for organic farming &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;much less demand for soy milk as opposed to cow milk. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_milk_consumption_per_capita&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; indicates about 200-300 litres/year/capita for cow milk, as opposed to less than 1 litre/year/capita for soy milk according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://envormation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Soy-milk-an-attributional-Life-Cycle-Assessment-examining-the-potential-environmental-impact-of-soy-milk.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this source&lt;/a&gt;. This is especially important, because much of the cost (for many products) is derived from fixed costs, so products sold in large quantities have an advantage.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;high gross margins for producers. An example is &lt;a href=&quot;http://financials.morningstar.com/ratios/r.html?t=00345&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Vitasoy International Holdings Ltd&lt;/a&gt; which reported a Gross margin of about 50% in the recent year. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is very hard to estimate the price if soy milk volumes would be at the same order of magnitude with those of cow milk. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/business-18951422&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this source&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;production cost for milk in UK is about 0.62 pounds (0.77$ or 0.73€).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[EDIT]&#xA;As suggested, I will try to improve the answer by providing extra information about soy milk production cost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home made&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-Homemade-Soy-Milk/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this simple recipe&lt;/a&gt;, home made soy milk costs about 0.5$ per 2.75 quarts (2.6 liters) &lt;strong&gt;which is 0.2$ per liter.&lt;/strong&gt;. So, it is clearly less expensive than cow milk and much cheaper than commercial soy milk (if time, effort, electricity and other small factors are ignored).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Results can be improved by using specialized devices such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00ALM5ZFM&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; (about 129$ when writing this answer).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industrially made&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the industrial perspective, it is not efficient to obtain soy milk only, but to also obtain other products from soy, to alleviate fixed costs (equipment, salaries, power etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0532e/t0532e15.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this source&lt;/a&gt; the following are the costs for equipment required for processing in various scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The French Oil Mill Machinery Company example 1 - 1570 grands &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The French Oil Mill Machinery Company example 2 - 647 grands&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Example 3 - 112 grands&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in most cases the initial investment is quite big. The final cost will depend on many factors such as salaries, power bills, equipment maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Side note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One important aspect is that not only money would be saved, if people switched to soy-milk. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://theconversation.com/soy-versus-dairy-whats-the-footprint-of-milk-8498&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CO2 footprint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Cornell University scientist, David Pimentel, has found it takes about&#xA;  14 kilo-calories (kcal) of fossil-fuel energy to produce 1kcal of milk&#xA;  protein using conventional milk production. Organically produced milk&#xA;  might require a little less than 10kcal of fossil-fuel energy per&#xA;  kcal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In comparison, Pimentel’s data suggests that in a conventional soybean&#xA;  production system, one kcal of fossil energy invested produces about&#xA;  3.2kcal of soybean. For 1kcal of fossil energy invested in organic soybean production, you get an average of 3.8kcal of soybeans.

Foods fortified with vitamin B-12 include meat&#xA;  substitute products, soymilks, tofu, cereals, and nutritional yeast.&#xA;  Seaweed and tempeh are generally not reliable sources of vitamin B-12.&#xA;  &lt;strong&gt;Four servings daily of vitamin B-12 fortified foods are recommended in&#xA;  pregnancy and lactation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vitamin D3&lt;/strong&gt; deficiency, besides the food, is also related to exposure to sunlight and skin color (&quot;dark-skinned people require longer exposure to obtain sufficient amounts&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Women who have regular sunlight exposure do not need any extra vitamin&#xA;  D. However, in the absence of adequate exposure to sunlight, 5 mcg/day&#xA;  or 200 IU in the form of cholecalciferol is recommended. There is no&#xA;  increased requirement for vitamin D during pregnancy and lactation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Vegans must rely heavily on ultraviolet B rays -- the band of&#xA;  ultraviolet which causes synthesis of vitamin D-3 -- from direct&#xA;  sunlight to obtain sufficient D-3. Good sources of vitamin D are&#xA;  found in fish liver oils, fatty fish, and egg yolks, but vitamin&#xA;  content in these foods varies by the time of year.[17] &lt;strong&gt;Vitamin&#xA;  D-fortified foods include cow's milk, some soy milk products, and some&#xA;  breakfast cereals.

Other choices with slightly less&#xA;  calcium bioavailability are &lt;strong&gt;fortified soymilk, sesame seeds, almonds,&#xA;  and red and white beans&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Plant sources of iron have decreased bioavailability compared to animal sources, and are more sensitive to interactions with other nutrients that can facilitate or inhibit absorption. Inhibitors of iron absorption include calcium, coffee, and fiber. Vitamin C can help enhance absorption by reducing the inhibitory effects of phytate. Both pregnant and lactating women are encouraged to eat &lt;strong&gt;plant-based foods high in iron, such as soy products, tofu, beans, lentils, spinach, molasses, whole wheat breads, peas, dried apricots, prunes, and raisin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein&lt;/strong&gt; requirement is significantly increased during pregnancy &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein requirements during pregnancy and lactation are increased to 71 g/day compared to 46 g/day for the nonpregnant woman.

So, &lt;strong&gt;it is a chance that the 6% difference can be gained by the vegetarians&lt;/strong&gt;. Also, the &lt;strong&gt;other causes of death changes changes are expected to be very small&lt;/strong&gt; (except for malignant neoplasms which is detailed below).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/01/vegetarians-blood-cancer-diet-risk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...] &lt;strong&gt;vegetarians&lt;/strong&gt; are 45% less likely to develop cancer of the blood&#xA;  than meat eaters and &lt;strong&gt;are 12% less likely to develop cancer overall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;12% is clearly too low to make a position change in the top.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, my opinion is that the most probably main causes of death for vegetarians should be the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cardiovascular diseases:  ~23%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Infectious and parasitic diseases: ~23%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Malignant neoplasms (cancers): ~11%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Respiratory diseases: &gt;6.5%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Unintentional injuries: &gt;6.2%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; I have scaled mortality rates with the reduced change of dying from that particular disease (where sources indicate that mortality rate is significantly changed by being a vegetarian).

Vitamin C increases the absorption rate of non-heme iron, the type that is found in vegetable sources.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;consuming less, or avoiding, foods that decrease your iron absorption, such as coffee and alcohol,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;reducing or quitting dairy, since calcium competes with iron carriers, in other words excess of calcium might increase the iron deficiency,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;take care of your gut, since a healthy gut is the best way to optimize nutrients absorption; and a gut that is not healthy might lead to deficiencies even without sport training. You take care of your gut by eating a good amount of vegetables and fruits, that help you with fiber and vitamins. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, some sources refer to gluten as a possible concurrent cause of nutrient deprivation, although the matter is still highly disputed.

As far as I know, they don't harbor harmful bacteria, like say, chicken. Eating insects in fruit is likely to have no particular impact on health because the volumes are so small.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Vegetarians get the bulk of their calories from grains, which are less impactful than animal husbandry in most ecosystems. Fruit is about 100 calories a pound, and is eaten in about the same quantity by omnivores as vegetarians. My suspicion is that the worst problems with the environment are not the orchards and the number of orchards would change that much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethics&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;If the insect is already dead by the time you get the fruit it isn't a problem. (By this line of reasoning, road kill is vegan!) Almost all figs have a bug in them of some sort- wasps, etc. No intentional act of a human led to that insects death, so it isn't our fault it crawled into a piece of fruit, ate, and died. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deciding what to do about other small life that is making trouble for us, but isn't dead yet is more complicated and calls for case by case reasoning. &lt;a href=&quot;https://normphelpsdotorg1.wordpress.com/the-rights-of-flies-and-fleas/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;This essay is a fascinating example&lt;/a&gt;. The strategies that bugs use to get through life put them in to direct conflict with our desires to live- they eat our houses, drink our blood and end up in our all manners of potential food sources. So even if we value the life of an insect as much as a cow or ourselves, we will still end up in the place of deciding which one will live. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion this is a sort of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;trolley problem&lt;/a&gt;&quot; where our intuitive sense of ethics fails us and it isn't clear what answer is correct.

The usual vegan response is that the project of veganism is about harm reduction and not a perfectionist project of never killing anything. Also, if we have to choose the killing of the small (insects, mice) is less problematic that killing the large who generally more intelligent and aware of their suffering, if only because killing a short lived insect is depriving it of fewer of it's remaining days of life than a normally long lived cow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="320" LastActivityDate="2017-02-27T13:14:38.380" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

These policies should include preventing factory farms from polluting and requiring them to pay cleanup costs when they do pollute. Without such policies, &lt;strong&gt;the products of factory farms will continue to be artificially cheap&lt;/strong&gt;, in that prices will not reflect their impact on the environment, human health, animal welfare, or the economic and social stability of rural communities. Both the individual and collective actions described above would hasten &lt;strong&gt;the shift toward a more sustainable agriculture&lt;/strong&gt;, which is an important component in the larger transition to a sustainable economy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One personal act that can have a profound impact on these issues is reducing meat consumption. To produce 1 pound of feedlot beef requires about 2,400 gallons of water and 7 pounds of grain (42). Considering that the average American consumes 97 pounds of beef (and 273 pounds of meat in all) each year,&#xA;even modest reductions in meat consumption in such a culture would substantially reduce the burden on our natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/opinion/the-myth-of-sustainable-meat.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; deals with the debate about sustainability of small farms vs. industrial farming. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Grass-grazing cows emit considerably more methane than grain-fed cows.&#xA;  Pastured organic chickens have a 20 percent greater impact on global&#xA;  warming. It requires 2 to 20 acres to raise a cow on grass. If we&#xA;  raised all the cows in the United States on grass (all 100 million of&#xA;  them), cattle would require (using the figure of 10 acres per cow)&#xA;  almost half the country’s land (and this figure excludes space needed&#xA;  for pastured chicken and pigs).

However, we do not have to reach this space usage: if small/organic farming is used more and industrial farming is forced to play &quot;fair&quot;, the meat production volume will get lower. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in real terms, small farming cannot possible reach the volume of industrial farming, thus generating less environment harmful effects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="36" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T13:01:23.880" LastActivityDate="2017-03-02T21:24:42.143" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In addition, the standard transfer paper contains lanolin (wool fat), so that's not vegan either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a full explanation (edited) from &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitesizevegan.com/vegan-lifestyle-2/are-tattoos-vegan-guide-to-a-vegan-tattoo/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;bitesize vegan website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Tattoo ink is formed of a pigment, which gives the ink its color,&#xA;  suspended within a carrier solution.  The pigment is usually derived&#xA;  from plants or metal.  Now, what my astute commenter was referring to&#xA;  with the bone bit of his comment, however, is black ink, also called&#xA;  “bone black” which can–but doesn’t always–contain charcoal and soot&#xA;  derived from the charred bones of animals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Carrier solutions generally contain purified water, ethyl alcohol,&#xA;  propylene glycol and glycerine and may also contain witch hazel.  For&#xA;  vegans, it’s the glycerine we have to watch out for.  It can be from&#xA;  either plants or from animal fats depending on the company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Aside from bone char pigment and glycerine carrier solutions, there&#xA;  are other animal bits in tattoo inks to keep an eye out for.  Some&#xA;  inks also use gelatin and shellac.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Luckily there are plenty of vegan inks on the market, some of which&#xA;  have the bonus of being non-toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Outside of the ink itself, other elements of the tattoo process can be&#xA;  animal-laden.  Many artists use vaseline or petroleum jelly during&#xA;  tattooing to help their tattoo machine glide more easily. petroleum&#xA;  jelly itself can by and large be considered animal-free, although it’s&#xA;  a byproduct of the oil industry, which is a bit concerning, and the&#xA;  vaseline brand itself can contain bone char depending on the country&#xA;  and definitely tests on animals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;One lesser-known hidden animal product in the tattoo experience is the&#xA;  lanolin in transfer paper, which comes from sheep’s wool. You see when&#xA;  you get a tattoo, unless you have a badass free-hander, your artist&#xA;  will draw the image out on what looks like tracing paper and apply it&#xA;  to your glistening moist skin to leave an outline to follow.  This&#xA;  allows you and your artist to work out ideal positioning and allows&#xA;  you a bit of a preview.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Luckily, there is a vegan transfer paper out there by Reprofx.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, go to a tattoo place that explicitly advertises itself as vegan (and that you trust), if you are concerned about these things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="74" LastActivityDate="2017-03-06T14:50:01.083" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It's definitely not animal skin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Devil's in the details&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, every artificial leather uses its own production formula, and it's &lt;em&gt;theoretically&lt;/em&gt; possible that minor chemical additives have an animal source.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, if all you know is that the material you're thinking of is called “rexine”, there's no way to know for certain, since that's not enough information to know what the material actually is and track down its production formula. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Brand-name Rexine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a specific type of artificial leather produced by Rexine LTD of the United Kingdom, but much like “kleenex” in the United States, the brand name “Rexine” has suffered from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_trademark&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;brand genericisation&lt;/a&gt;, and now many different materials are popularly called “rexine”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Brand-name Rexine: probably vegan&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia's record of the formula&lt;/a&gt;, actual brand-name Rexine is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; produced without animal products: it's made from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrocellulose&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;nitrocellulose&lt;/a&gt; (which is itself made from cellulose and laboratory-produced, mineral-sourced nitric acid), camphor oil, pigment and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The “probably” is because of the non-specific use of “&lt;strong&gt;pigment&lt;/strong&gt;”: the vast majority of industrial processes use synthetic pigments rather than naturally-derived ones, due to greater colour-fastness and lower cost, but since animal-sourced pigments do &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt;, it's possible — however unlikely — that some colours of Rexine are coloured with an animal-derived pigment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Buyer beware, and do more research&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For all other artificial leathers, the specific manufacturer must be identified, and this can't be done just by finding out what trade name the material goes under. To find out exactly what a specific artificial leather is made out of, you'll have to contact the manufacturer directly and inquire about their formula's sources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Artificial leathers are definitely not animal skin, and at that “large scale”, they're not animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; likely that any given artificial leather brand does not contain any animal-derived ingredients.  For many artificial leather brands, this is the entire purpose. However, it's possible that a given artificial leather brand might use some innocuous chemical as part of its plastic production, which might have some animal source somewhere in its own production history. This is unlikely, but a possibility. If 100% vegan artificial leather is the goal, then the only way to be sure is to talk to the manufacturer of the specific artificial leather and get their response on how they source all ingredients for their formula.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="382" LastActivityDate="2017-03-08T18:47:45.390" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In general, you can imitate that &lt;em&gt;texture&lt;/em&gt; using other ingredients in 2 ways:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Use added fat.  You can replace the fat content of nuts or coconut with another source, like vegetable oil or vegan butter.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Use a thickener.  There are all sorts of thickeners with different texture properties: flour (recommended), potato starch (recommended), cornstarch, arrowroot powder, tapioca starch (not recommended for Alfredo sauce, it produces a stretchy, cheese-like consistency that's good for cheese sauces but not cream sauces), etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as imitating creamy &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt; of dairy cream or of cashew cream, that's little bit hard, because there aren't many things that taste as close to dairy cream as blended cashew will.  But you can still produce delicious things, so just experiment.  Sometimes adding a tiny amount of a sour ingredient (like apple cider vinegar or lemon juice) or a sweet ingredient (like sugar) will help change the flavor to what you want (dairy often has both sour and sweet notes, because lactic acid is sour, and lactose is slightly sweet).  If you don't know how these things will change the flavor of the sauce when you're cooking it and are afraid of ruining it, you can take out a small portion of the sauce from the pot, and experiment with seasoning it (that way if it goes wrong, you haven't ruined the whole pot).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="383" LastEditorUserId="383" LastEditDate="2017-03-08T21:01:15.247" LastActivityDate="2017-03-08T21:01:15.247" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

By 2050, global fish populations could double if all&#xA;  countries switched to the best management practices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This can be achieved by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;well-enforced quota system&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;in a catch share system (also called a fishing rights system), each fisherman is entitled to a percentage of the total allocated haul. The catch is set by scientists based on the best evidence at the time. If the number of fish in the ocean rises, the number that can be caught can quickly be revised. That gives all fishermen an incentive to use best practices and police their own waters, says Leland, so everyone's piece of the pie gets bigger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reduce wasteful bycatch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not a direct answer to your question, but we can safely assume that if a large part of humans gives up eating fish, it will produce a similar effect to enforced quotas. So, &lt;strong&gt;a few years can be the answer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6798/full/406882a0.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; from Nature is less optimistic:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;With the possible exception of herring and related species that mature&#xA;  early in life and are fished with highly selective equipment, my&#xA;  analysis of 90 stocks reveals that many gadids (for example, cod,&#xA;  haddock) and other non-clupeids (for example, flatfishes) have&#xA;  experienced little, if any, recovery as much as 15 years after 45–99%&#xA;  reductions in reproductive biomass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in order to fully answer your question, it is important to know how much the biomass was reduced in certain place and its type (e.g. fish species), to be able to evaluate the recovery period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; putting all the information together, I think the ocean, as a whole, can be largely restored &lt;strong&gt;in just few years&lt;/strong&gt;, if vegetarians are about 50% of the total population. However, some places may need much more than that (up to 15 years) to fully recover.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; it is important to note that the premise (which is highly implausible today) is not necessary for the oceans to recover in a relatively short period. Political will can change this, as indicated in the National Geographic article:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., since 2000, there has been a &lt;strong&gt;70 percent drop in the&#xA;  number of overfished species&lt;/strong&gt;. The number of fish with rebuilt&#xA;  populations has risen from zero to 39. At the same time, the number of&#xA;  jobs in fishing has risen by 31 percent in the past three years while&#xA;  revenue has risen 44 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In Belize, which has a small artisanal fishery, fishermen have gone&#xA;  from competing with each other to advocating for more protected areas&#xA;  so that fish have safe spawning grounds.

In some areas, there are concerns that even if all fishing stopped, the ecosystem would never return to it's former state. Part of the reason is that over fishing is not the only factor effecting marine life. Warming waters and increased extreme weather also have a large impact. The Gulf of Maine is one example of this&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/10/warming-waters-hit-new-england-cod-fishery-hard/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Over fishing itself can throw an ecosystem out of balance. After fisheries were shut in Cape Cod in the early 1990s, an explosion in the population of foragers prevented plankton numbers from recovering and predators from reaching maturity. It wasn't until around 2010 that predator populations have begun to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the closing of a number of fisheries around the world, we have some data on how quickly marine ecosystems recover.

Results in individual fisheries vary widely however, from a 98.3% increase over 2 years in one part of the English Channel, to a 30.6% decline over 10 years in one South African fishery. Data on catch per unit effort (a measure of species abundance) from nine marine reserves shows an &lt;strong&gt;average increase of fish abundance of 15.4% per year&lt;/strong&gt;.

I will try to address each one first and then draw a conclusion about human brain afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the &lt;strong&gt;total number of neurons&lt;/strong&gt;, elephants have much bigger brain in terms of total number of neurons than humans with ~257 billions of neurons in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4053853/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;elephant's brain&lt;/a&gt; compared to ~87 billions of neurons in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3386878/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;human brain&lt;/a&gt;. We do not see elephants solving quadratic equations with a swing of their trunk though and so it is clear that simply the total number of neurons alone, while indicative of computational power, is not a good measure of cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Should we take a look at the &lt;strong&gt;brain and body size relationship&lt;/strong&gt; instead? Not really. While we as humans do score rather highly for this criteria (brain size is 2% of total body mass), even better so do marmosets with their 2,7%. Marmosets are small primates and they do not belong to the brightest of primates. It does not seem likely brain and body size ratio is the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could we explain this with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalization_quotient&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;encephalization quotient&lt;/a&gt; instead? &lt;strong&gt;Encephalisation quotient&lt;/strong&gt; is a ratio between actual brain mass and a predicted brain mass for an animal of given size.

Probably. For example because it does not account for things such as &lt;strong&gt;neural density&lt;/strong&gt;. Neural density, for example, may be one of the reasons why birds are acting intelligently while having such small brains. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/113/26/7255&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; determines that birds are able to pack twice as many neurons as primates to the same brain size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If size is out of the picture, what else could we look at? Where human and elephant brains differ notably is for example &lt;strong&gt;where these neurons are located&lt;/strong&gt;.

Is this the defining characteristic for human like cognition? And if so, what about great apes whose brains are similarly constructed with rather high numbers of neurons in the cerebral cortex? Although human brain was for long believed to be unique and somewhat outlier amongst animal brains, this notion is gradually being debunked as can be seen for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19226510&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3386878/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the studies show that human brain is simply a scaled-up version of primate brain.

Such anatomical specializations might&#xA;potentially provide increased capacity for enhanced neuronal&#xA;integration to support executive cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since our knowledge about the functions of the cerebral cortex shows that it is the centre of abilities we usually associate with consciousness and higher cognitive processes, we could simply stop here and conclude that what is needed to achieve human-like cognition is a certain number of neurons (with there being a non-linear relationship between the number of neurons and cognitive abilities, hence our much better cognitive abilities comapred to other priamtes) with a certain proportion of these neurons located in cerebral cortex (this being the reason why elephants are not an intellectual master race) and with a certain proportion of cortical gray matter being composed of neuropil (giving us advantage over other primates).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, things are not so simple still. &lt;strong&gt;This conclusion would exclude animals which we know pass some tests related to consciousness&lt;/strong&gt; (I will be addressing this later) such as some types of birds or even invertebrates such as octopuses, &lt;strong&gt;but which do not belong to the Mammalia class and do not have cerebral cortex&lt;/strong&gt; at all. To explain this, we could look for similar structures in non-mammalian brains, perhaps based on the genetical similarities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wiringthebrain.com/2010/09/ancient-origins-of-cerebral-cortex.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;This can be hard.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether particular brain structures in different species are related&#xA;to each other (i.e., whether they diverged from a single structure in&#xA;a common ancestor) is often a subject of debate and controversy. It&#xA;can be difficult if not impossible to determine based solely on&#xA;location, anatomical organization or functional similarity. This is&#xA;because it is relatively easy for these parameters to change over the&#xA;course of evolution – they can be affected by changes to one or two&#xA;genes, which means there is plenty of variation in these phenotypes&#xA;within the population – the raw material for evolution by natural&#xA;selection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But luckily:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the final phenotypic end-point of any particular region is quite&#xA;variable, the opposite is true of the genetic pathways that specify&#xA;the identity of the region at earlier stages of development. These&#xA;involve master regulatory genes, whose expression is turned on or off&#xA;in various parts of the embryo...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;...These genes interact in a complicated network of feedforward and&#xA;feedback loops to orchestrate this complicated sequence. The networks&#xA;in which they operate are so interlocked and involved in so many&#xA;different parts of the embryo that mutations to any one gene tend to&#xA;have very drastic consequences and will be rapidly selected against.&#xA;These early regulatory systems are thus far less variable and tend to&#xA;be highly conserved across evolution...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is thus possible to tell whether a brain region in one species is&#xA;homologous to one in another species (which may look quite different&#xA;in its mature characteristics) by looking at how those regions were&#xA;specified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And after the introduction, &lt;strong&gt;the interesting par&lt;/strong&gt;t:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similar patterns of gene expression argue that the cortex of mammals&#xA;and the “pallium” of birds and reptiles are indeed related to each&#xA;other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And even more interestingly, the study mentioned later on in the article has found out that &lt;strong&gt;the commonalities go as far as mushroom bodies of a certain annelid worm&lt;/strong&gt;, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platynereis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Platynereis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is therefore &lt;strong&gt;not only possible, but highly plausible, that even species which do not possess cerebral cortex may be capable of the same or similar things as those who do&lt;/strong&gt; (and as we shall see later, they do seem to be capable of these).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have read my answer up until here, you may wonder what all this has to do with the presence of consciousness. I have included much of the previous information for two reasons. It is, I believe, insanely interesting and, more importantly, &lt;strong&gt;it shows just how much there is we have to take into account&lt;/strong&gt; if we want to try and biologically determine the likelihood of a certain animal having consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;strong&gt;does the presence of cerebral cortex really shows that other animals are conscious?&lt;/strong&gt; As I mentioned in the disclaimer, we cannot know. We can suppose though. And based on what we know about cerebral cortex, based on what we know about brain structure and based on what we know about the genetic origin of similar structures in other classes of animals than mammals, I would venture to claim that &lt;strong&gt;we can assume that many animals possess at least some level of consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that cerebral cortex, found in mammal's brains, is heavily involved in higher cognitive processes which we usually associate with consciousness. Comparing human brain with that of other mammals, there is no single defining factor that would make ourselves cognizant - and, by its lack, render other animals incognizant - that we know of. This goes, however, beyond the Mammalia class, based on genetical similarities in brain formation etc. it is highly possible that even animals without cerebral cortex (and therefore - if we just had a simple look at its functions and assuemd its lack will signify the lack of these functions - without higher cognitive abilities) do have some similarly performing structures in their brains which may indicate consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And to add some further credibility to my conclusions, here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.ie/books?id=UyAhBQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA51&amp;amp;redir_esc=y&amp;amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;conclusion from the &amp;quot;Consciousness in Humans and Non-human animals&amp;quot; conference&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the&#xA;neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of&#xA;conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional&#xA;behaviors. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans&#xA;are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate&#xA;consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and&#xA;many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these&#xA;neurological substrates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Attendees of which also said that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The absence of a neocortex does not appear to preclude an organism&#xA;from experiencing affective states,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;animal passing a test conerning a function that we usually link to the consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since this answer is already long enough and there are others who talked about this point before me (great answer was given by Alexei), I will just shortly describe this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way we can determine if an animal is conscious or not is to &lt;strong&gt;try and define what we think conscious means and devise tests for animals to pass&lt;/strong&gt; in order to peruade us of their consciousness. This has been done many times with many animals, with really interesting results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I may change this later but as of now, I will simply link to some interesting findings and studies for some animals (I really love the octopus ones).

Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and&#xA;  many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neural&#xA;  substrates.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, there seem to be no special difference between us humans and other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A similar question was put on Philosophy SE site and it received a very interesting answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I think we should avoid a moral basis in absolute human value, which&#xA;  seems to me to culminate in the tradition of trophy hunting, where&#xA;  human comfort and enjoyment is of value, and the lives of animals hold&#xA;  little intrinsic value. Instead, we should look at the agreements&#xA;  'negotiated' by our societies and our genes, and consider where&#xA;  everyone's best interests lie, but accept that we will always value&#xA;  those more like ourselves higher than others to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, that's not a definite answer (it's philosophy, after all, much more questions than answers), but it leads us to the idea that humans might have more intrinsic values. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(ethics)#Life_stances_and_intrinsic_value&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; tells us about various intrinsic value of humans. I think that some of them do not apply to animals.

Clearly, in the US, that's no longer the case. I think political inertia and the lack of a political base strongly advocating to eliminate them are why they still exist. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think there are two main reasons that the US agricultural subsidies appear to be directed towards animal agriculture is that its traditionally more capital intensive than crop agriculture and its harder for the individual, small farmer to regulate the supply of their product to stabilize falling prices. Animal agriculture is also less diversified than crop agriculture.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, the dairy industry is/was uniquely volatile in a way that could easily bankrupt smaller dairy farmers. The business is capital intensive in that you need to buy cows, feed cows, and buy equipment to milk the cows. That doesn't even get into all the storage and distribution costs. This means dairy farmers were often highly in debt and had to make large, regular debt payments. The product, however, is a commodity that is highly perishable, which means the farmers lack the ability to &lt;em&gt;not sell&lt;/em&gt; when prices collapse like most grain growers can. Their choices are to sell today at a lower price or never sell it. They may even buy additional cows to make up lost revenue, which pushes prices down even more. This means that when the price for milk drops, the supply doesn't drop, meaning the price just stays low until the farmers are bankrupt. The farmer can't use any of his dairy investments in other crops or uses, so he is locked into dairy farming. To help offset this, the US will buy surplus dairy to prop up demand for the milk and keep prices from falling too much. In many dairy producing states, there are additional controls on top of direct subsidies to help stop prices from falling too much. In Pennsylvania, where I am from, there are price floors on how low of a price you can sell milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="428" LastActivityDate="2017-03-15T16:08:18.103" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This type of question can seem inflammatory for the reason that the asker doesn't realise they are entering such well-trodden ground. I hope we can maintain a community that is friendly and welcoming enough to patiently answer such questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; Yes if they have some degree of sentience, then they deserve moral consideration. Practically, though, they're the food source that causes the least amount of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extended TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, if there is good evidence of conscious experience, then of course they deserve moral consideration. More practically, if plants do hold moral value, it's definitely &lt;em&gt;not a good idea&lt;/em&gt; to eat animals since those animals had to eat &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_conversion_ratio&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;a large mass of plant matter to produce a small mass of consumable meat&lt;/a&gt;. For example, for every kilo of beef you eat, you're &quot;eating&quot; about 6 kilos of grain. If you ate the grain directly you'd get more energy, more protein, more fibre, more everything (except for a few nutrients like B12). You'd cause far less suffering by eating plants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Answer:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If good science does show that plants are capable of conscious experience and suffering, then yes, they most certainly do deserve moral consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside:&lt;/strong&gt; Debating what &quot;conscious experience and suffering&quot; actually means could be within the scope of this question, but I think we can provide a practical/prescriptive answer without getting into that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First things first: We must agree that consciousness and sentience aren't binary. Instead, varying degrees of consciousness are possible. Here's a terrible diagram:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/wOXUC.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/wOXUC.png&quot; alt=&quot;relative moral value&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously this isn't anywhere near accurate or to scale or in proportion - it's just to illustrate that there is a spectrum of moral value. If we care about the moral value of other organisms, but we also want to survive (debates about selfishness aside), then we should try to ensure that our diets have the smallest practical negative moral consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you disagree that plants have a lower moral value than animals (like cows, chickens, etc.), then I'd have to call your bluff. I can't imagine that anyone actually believes this. If they'd just as easily burn a dog alive as they would a lettuce plant, then I think my convincing them is outside of the scope of this question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So then the question becomes: How do we achieve the &quot;smallest practical negative moral consequences&quot;? What is considered &quot;practical&quot; by a person depends on their willingness to forego pleasure for the sake of reducing the harm they're doing to others. It also depends on the scientific consensus regarding the sentience of the various food candidates. It's still early days in our scientific understanding of consciousness and sentience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moving beyond these questions into more concrete prescriptions of good behaviour requires a lot of utilitarian and scientific ground-work and is probably best answered on a situation-by-situation basis. As an example of the &quot;moral calculus&quot; that we must deal with as we start to move into this territory: A person may justify eating plants by demonstrating that the effort that it would take to switch to and maintain a algae-based diet would detract from their other positive moral endeavours such that they'd thus be able to do less good in the world. Indeed, it may be quite hard to fulfil one's dietary requirements using only algae today, given that they currently don't exist in supermarkets on a large scale. One hundred years ago, this may have been a sane and valid argument for avoiding a vegan diet (pre algal B12 synthesis, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Achieving the &quot;smallest practical negative moral consequences&quot; is a tough one, but since this is a vegetarian/vegan forum, the question is a usually little more simple: &quot;Should we avoid eating animals?&quot; In this case we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; prescribe moral behaviour using only the knowledge that plants have a lower moral value than that of the herbivorous animals that we eat. The argument is simple: The animals that we eat must eat several kilos of plants to produce some smaller mass of food (meat, eggs, milk, etc.). The resulting animal product has less energy, less protein, less fibre and, in general, less nutrients than the original plant matter. Thus, if don't filter our food through the herbivores, we're able to get the same amount of energy, protein, etc. and have killed less plants overall. So we can see that there's no need to know the absolute moral value of plants if we just care about practical ethics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, in summary:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, plants do deserve moral consideration. We should try to avoid assigning moral value purely on the basis of species membership (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(biology)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; membership in this case). An organism's moral value should depend on its capacity for conscious experience and sentience as estimated via the available scientific data. Following this understanding, we should be careful not to fall into this trap: &quot;I'd still be causing suffering even if I only ate plants. I can't stop all suffering, so I'll just give up altogether and not worry about morality.&quot; That's an irrational and immoral position to take. Instead we should attempt to &lt;em&gt;minimise&lt;/em&gt; the suffering that is caused by our diets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside:&lt;/strong&gt; It's also worth noting that many of the plant products that we eat don't require us to kill or harm the plant. Fruits, nuts and many cereals/grains have evolved to work in symbiosis with animals such that the animals get to eat, and the plants get their seeds spread around (and often get a nice head-start be being embedded in nutrient-rich animal dung). Humans are in a &lt;em&gt;species-level&lt;/em&gt; symbiotic relationship with the domesticated animals that we consume/use, but unfortunately the &lt;em&gt;individual's&lt;/em&gt; well-being isn't increased by this species-level relationship. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_bear&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;bile bear farms&lt;/a&gt; may increase the number of sun bears in existence, and in that case sun bears would be in a species-level symbiotic relationship with the humans that breed them, but of course the wellness of the individual sun bears is not increased (rather, it is decreased considerably). So we've got to be careful not to conflate the &quot;success&quot; of the &lt;em&gt;species&lt;/em&gt; with the wellness of the &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt;. In this way, the word &quot;symbiosis&quot; can be deceiving (certainly in its colloquial sense).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.S. The OP's question was simply about whether plants deserve moral consideration.

Nut butter (spread on bread or mixed into smoothies, yogurts, oatmeal or other food) or nut powder is a great source of fat and also provides protein and some vitamins and minerals. Depending on availability you might be able to offer fat-rich fruits such as avocado (a baby-led-weaning favourite), and acai. Just try to avoid foods with hydrogenated vegetable oils that contain trans fats, as these are harmful to health.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vegan babies (like all other vegans) should take a B12 supplement once they stop drinking breast milk or formula. &lt;a href=&quot;https://plantbasedjuniors.com/dha-needs-for-kids/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Breastfeeding vegans should take a DHA supplement and babies may benefit from a DHA supplement once weaned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another nutrient worth paying extra attention to in vegetarian and vegan (and even omnivorous) diets is iron. There are many plant sources of iron, but this iron is less bioavailable than that in meat (dairy products are not sources of iron). To improve absorption of iron, serve iron-rich foods such as beans, tofu, green vegetables, peanut butter, chia seeds etc to your baby &lt;strong&gt;alongside a source of vitamin C&lt;/strong&gt; such as strawberries, capsicum, kiwifruit, pineapple, papaya, citrus fruits etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also related: &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/questions/409/what-vegan-food-should-i-feed-to-a-baby?rq=1&quot;&gt;What vegan food should I feed to a baby?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="74" LastEditorUserId="74" LastEditDate="2023-09-20T05:52:21.800" LastActivityDate="2023-09-20T05:52:21.800" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

There are many reasons why you may follow vegan diet; they are all interesting and when you overcome the initial &quot;strange and sounds a bit weird&quot; feeling your family may have about veganism, it will make it much more likely for them to accept your stance and stop nagging you about it.

The environmental impact was my primary motivator.

I make the case that in those cases, it &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; follow from your morals (when you include at least self-preservation as a moral good too) that you can't use animal product so that in some cases, it is justified to use them. Gelatin may sometimes be such a case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following moral goals is equivalent to minimizing the ways in which you act against those moral goals. For practically relevant morals such as those concerned here, you can't always follow them, which is why phrasing them as above is useful. Examples of how you can't follow them are plentiful: If you give anyone money (in exchange for &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;) whom you know not to follow your morals, you are supporting them in not following your morals and acting against your own morals. If you live in a house, consider the whole dependency tree of a house (land, work, building supplies, work creating the building supplies, supplies for creating the building supplies and so on recursively) and the myriad ways this kills/harms animals and the negative ecological impact this has. If you sometimes use cars or planes instead of going on foot, hell, if you use a bike instead of going on foot or use shoes instead of going barefoot. You probably don't do this consciously, but you are continuously balancing self preservation (or egoism, and can you even tell where the line between two is, exactly?) and your other morals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have established that this is not about absolutes, it should also be clear that compromises are possible. You have to act against your morals, so you choose the least evils.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And sometimes, such a least evil can be to just buy something which looks morally-okay enough to you (but not completely okay) but which has other advantages which can make this a zero net moral implications trade off or even a positive one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Buying (or even just eating) things which contain small amounts of animal matter, or using (but not buying or otherwise contributing to demand for the product) even high-animal content products can almost always be at least a zero net effect trade off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gelatin-containing foods are sometimes like this: They don't contain much gelatin and gelatin being a byproduct of meat production which could be replaced relatively cheaply means you are not driving slaughtering demand up much: If the animals wouldn't be slaughtered anyway, it would be cheaper to use something else than gelatin (the producer &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;, too because after all they are capitalists). On the other hand if gelatin demand was lower than the amount which can be provided by the amount of animal slaughtering going on anyway, those byproducts would like just be thrown away or used for something less productive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So for example when you have apple juice of cost x$ versus vegan apple juice of cost 2x$ then it's very sensible to just buy the apple juice which is not certified vegan (but might very well be anyway) because even if gelatin is actually used for clearing it, the amount won't be large and you are free to use that money (and time you saved searching for the vegan one) for something which more than offsets the negative impact you (may have) had.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And in answer to the comment about vegan cheese: Well, this is difficult because with all my claims, I never have numbers to back it up and it's very hard to put stuff like this in numbers anyway (consider the &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; dependency trees of most stuff you buy and it's obvious why). For gelatin, you don't need numbers because even with worst case estimates, its negative impact can still reasonably be offset. Cheese takes a large amount of milk to make, and milk is no byproduct but the primary product of the milk industry. So if you are thinking about fondue or cheese and bread eaten like this, then it's unlikely that it's easy to compensate for eating it. One scenario in which it would be possible is if the vegan cheese was much more expensive not because you are feeding the coffers of some capitalist (as in &quot;vegan apple juice&quot;), but because it's really that expensive. Expensive things generally have large dependency trees (somewhere, that money is being spent) and thus a large negative impact on the environment and like that on animals, too (extinctions because of climate change, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could also argue against this (for example from a more idealist standpoint), but it remains a valid point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="476" LastEditorUserId="476" LastEditDate="2017-03-27T15:02:53.157" LastActivityDate="2017-03-27T15:02:53.157" CommentCount="5" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This is a simple mechanical/chemical response that doesn't require any level of consciousness, in the same way that your skin releasing melanin (causing tanning) in response to UV rays doesn't indicate that your skin is conscious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the plant found the chewing painful, then for this pain to be useful to the plant's survival, it would have to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;remember the unpleasantness afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;be motivated to make decisions (e.g. which direction to grow in) in order to avoid a similar experience.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;actually make a decision which resulted in less chewing by caterpillars than could be accomplished by the simple chemical release.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of which would be quite extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that plants feel pain and we haven't discovered the evidence and the mechanism yet. Just that chance is enough to say that yes, plants deserve moral consideration. The &lt;em&gt;expected value&lt;/em&gt; of hurting a plant is negative, even if the most likely scenario is that it is morally neutral. But the absolute value is small, so I can't think of any situation where this would tip the scales of a decision. There are much more significant factors in deciding whether or not to hurt plants, such as the impact on the environment, or our nutrition.

Veg dishes mostly either:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;omit the meat entirely, &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;replace the protein, or &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;could just as easily serve as a side/mezze, breakfast, or snack dish, instead of as a main dish.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm from Argentina, and anyone that's been can attest that most people there don't even know what the word &quot;vegetarian&quot; means.

Funnily enough, I get a similar feeling when I visit vegetarian or vegan restaurants in the US, with all their faux meat. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dishes like Lo mein and pho could go equally well with or without meat, or replacing it with tofu.

Later (e.g. now) I never think of meat except for other people. On the subject of protein, I view any dish with legumes (beans or peas or lentils) as &quot;the central dish&quot; -- i.e. they are &quot;the protein&quot; and never &quot;take a side role when a big protein comes into play&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might get some satisfaction from regional cuisines of countries with a Buddhist culture (some schools of Buddhism prefer vegetarianism), i.e. East Asia (China, even Thailand, etc.). I think it's a American-Chinese dish (maybe I met it in Singapore too) that's made with tofu and named &quot;Buddha's delight&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or &quot;falafel&quot; is an example from the middle-east (which I like as a fast food, but too difficult to home-make because they're deep-fried).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is South Indian cuisine. I think (perhaps wrongly, I'm no expert) that North Indian cuisine is Muslim-influenced and often includes meat, whereas South India is sort of natively vegetarian (though also including dairy products like yogurt, so not vegan).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's like learning a new language. For example, initially I understand French by translating from English (like, you understand vegetarian cuisine from a carnivorous or omnivorous perspective). Later I understand French fluently without translation (without reference to English), like a native. You wrote, &quot;Rice and beans, grilled vegetables, and salads, on the other hand, all take a side role when a big protein comes into play.&quot; If I go somewhere and they give me grilled vegetables and salads then I'm grateful that they're &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to &quot;speak vegetarian&quot;.

I admit that &quot;eating out&quot; is one of the difficulties of being vegetarian or vegan, depending on the country.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the UK for example, my memory of it is that it used to be (in the 1970s) that the selection of vegetarian fast food was either &quot;fish-and-chips without the fish&quot;, or &quot;rice-and-curry without the curry&quot;! Now there's much more choice. I think, I guess, that about 10% of the population (in the UK) is vegetarian, which is too big for restaurants to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider this scenario: a party of several (family or friends) want to go out to dinner. Only one of them is vegetarian. They stop and look at a menu and, if there isn't even a single vegetarian dish, then the whole party goes somewhere else. I guess it's for this reason that almost every restaurant in the UK now seems to offer at least one vegetarian selection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now consider the opposite scenario: a party of vegetarians with one carnivore (a guest) want to go out. If the (vegetarian) restaurant doesn't offer even one thing for the carnivore then the whole party must go elsewhere.

Foie gras is a one of these things.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;political/economical&lt;/strong&gt; - forbidding something is a tough decision within a liberal democracy because it costs the votes of those affected.

Supporters of a ban on bullfighting remain a minority in&#xA;  Spain. About 30% of Spaniards actively follow bullfighting in Spain.&#xA;  Despite its slow decrease in popularity among younger generations, it&#xA;  remains a widespread cultural activity with millions of followers&#xA;  throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article dives into the details when it comes to bullfighting pros and cons. The table within the conclusion provides some insight into many aspects of the bullfighting:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economy&lt;/strong&gt; - The industry of bullfighting is worth $3.3 million and employs more than 10,000 people, BUT bullfighting is heavily&#xA;  subsidized by the government&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attendance&lt;/strong&gt; - Only 10% of Spaniards support bullfighting.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tourism&lt;/strong&gt; - With bullfighting being banned in certain cities, it has affected the economy, BUT many people attend bullfights because&#xA;  they think if they do not, they are missing out on a piece of the&#xA;  experience. These people never come back and are often horrified by&#xA;  what happens during the fights.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artistic Merit&lt;/strong&gt; - Bullfighting is not a sport, but an art, BUT killing of an animal cannot possibly be considered an art.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural&lt;/strong&gt; - In 2010 bullfighting became a protected art form in Madrid. Bullfighting has been around for a very long time and is&#xA;  almost synonymous with the Spanish culture, BUT while it is important&#xA;  to preserve culture, there are certain traditions that need to be left&#xA;  behind in this modern era.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental impact&lt;/strong&gt; - The dehesas, which is where the bulls are raised for fighting, are protected areas of land that are home to&#xA;  other endangered animals that live in the area. Getting rid of&#xA;  bullfighting means these lands would end up being developed and these&#xA;  animals would lose their homes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, for those concerned with animal rights there is good news, as politics seems to favor their view:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedodo.com/france-will-no-longer-support-tradition-of-bullfighting-1242419924.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;France Will No Longer Support 'Tradition' Of Bullfighting&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Paris Court of Appeals handed a victory to animal rights&#xA;  organizations in June by removing bullfighting from France's esteemed&#xA;  cultural heritage list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3493792/Spain-considers-new-bullfighting-lite-rules-matadors-not-allowed-kill-animals.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Spain considers new 'bullfighting lite' rules&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Spanish city of Valencia is considering adopting a style of&#xA;  bullfighting in which the bull is not killed by the matador in the&#xA;  ring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example which also affects my native land (Romania) is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/blogs/certainideasofeurope/2008/01/christmas_pig_killing_traditio&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Christmas pig killing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="36" LastEditorUserId="36" LastEditDate="2017-03-30T13:17:48.010" LastActivityDate="2017-03-30T13:17:48.010" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The Council of Europe is an intergovernmental organization. Article 20 of its Statute requires a unanimous vote for any of its recommendations to be adopted. In everyday practice, the Council operates by 'rough consensus' and does not always require unanimity. This is informal practice, however. Presumably, decision-making reverts to unanimity if a delegation has strong reservations. The dissenting delegation then has a veto over any decision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would be surprised if France did not threaten to exercise its veto over a wholesale ban of foie gras production.

Vegans&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a vegan, I personally rely on nutritional yeast and multivitamins. There are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.veganhealth.org/b12/vegansources&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;important points&lt;/a&gt; which are worth learning more about:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Is B12 Vegan?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The vitamin B12 component in B12 supplements and fortified foods is&#xA;made by bacteria and sourced from bacteria cultures; it is not taken&#xA;from animal products. However, some companies might put gelatin in&#xA;their B12 supplements, though this appears to be less and less common.&#xA;It is easy to find vegan B12 supplements on the Internet or in grocery&#xA;stores in developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are some live food supplement companies that rely on spirulina&#xA;or other algae, rather than bacteria cultures, as a source of vitamin&#xA;B12. You should not rely on such products for your vitamin B12 as&#xA;testing has indicated it is not a reliable source of active vitamin&#xA;B12 (more information).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Streptomyces griseus, a bacterium once thought to be a yeast, was the&#xA;commercial source of vitamin B12 for many years (8, 9). The bacteria&#xA;Propionibacterium shermanii and Pseudomonas denitrificans have now&#xA;replaced S. griseus (10). At least one company, Rhone Poulenc&#xA;Biochimie of France, is using a genetically engineered microorganism&#xA;to produce B12 (11).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Fortified Foods&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many vegan foods fortified with B12. They include non-dairy&#xA;milks, meat substitutes, breakfast cereals, and one type of&#xA;nutritional yeast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Daily Value&amp;quot; for B12 found on food labels is based on 6 µg, which&#xA;was the RDA in 1968. If a label says a food has, for example, 25% of&#xA;the Daily Value of B12, it has 1.5 µg (25% of 6 µg = 1.5 µg).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Brewer's and Nutritional Yeasts&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brewer's and nutritional yeasts do not contain B12 unless they are&#xA;fortified with it. There is at least one vegan, B12-fortified yeast&#xA;currently on the market: Red Star Vegetarian Support Formula.&#xA;(Twinlab's SuperRich Yeast Plus contains whey).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Cooking&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tucker et al. (2000, USA, 13) found that vitamin B12 from fortified&#xA;breakfast cereals and dairy products was associated with better&#xA;vitamin B12 status than was B12 intake from red meat, poultry, and&#xA;fish, leading the researchers to suspect that the B12 from meat might&#xA;be damaged by cooking. The B12 in animal foods tends not to be&#xA;cyanocobalamin, the form used in fortified foods and that is more&#xA;stable during cooking. For example, in an acid medium (pH 4-7),&#xA;cyanocobalamin can withstand boiling at 120° C (1).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even so, for people wondering whether they are destroying the B12 in&#xA;their fortified foods by cooking, we do not have enough evidence to&#xA;know for certain, so it is safest to make sure you rely on uncooked&#xA;sources of vitamin B12.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="583" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-18T08:37:18.697" LastActivityDate="2017-04-04T09:49:14.337" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Sweet versions are sweetened with sugar. They will &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; be enriched with lard, butter, vegetable shortening, oil or milk. &lt;strong&gt;Baked&lt;/strong&gt; buns are very likely to be enriched with milk, butter and/or eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both of the recipes you link to are basically for standard steamed buns (the second one has an option for frying). The one in your photo appears to have been either fried (this may be done after steaming or used as the sole cooking method) or baked. By the evenness of the crust and the shape, I'm inclined to think it was baked. It looks to me like a baked bun overall.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.houseofannie.com/baked-red-bean-buns/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here's a recipe for baked red bean buns&lt;/a&gt; that I think is more similar to the bun in your photo than either of the vegan recipes you linked to, which are for a different (steamed/fried) type of bun.

A soft, fluffy texture may be achieved with skill and different ingredient combinations, vegan or otherwise. You &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be able to &lt;em&gt;smell&lt;/em&gt; the presence of dairy or lard, but I can't tell you how to do that, and you really have to eat it to get the full identification-by-aroma experience :( Ultimately you cannot be certain if the person who made the bun can't advise you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="74" LastEditorUserId="74" LastEditDate="2020-01-15T11:27:20.737" LastActivityDate="2020-01-15T11:27:20.737" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This is further supported if we consider the additional environmental impacts of farming livestock, such as methane emissions (e.g, cattle), run-off pollution, and genetically homogenous populations which breed diseases (e.g, Varroa mite in bees, PSA outbreaks in kiwifruit). Another consideration is that the water (irrigation), and land area (deforestation) required for crop farming is lower than animal feed relative to the amount of food produced (by kilogram or kilojoule). This is widely accepted and environmental reasons is one of the main reasons academics give for their Vegan diets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, it's more environmentally sustainable to be lower in the foodchain, it is the lesser of both impacts.

Both too much and too little iodine are problematic, and it's very hard to know exactly how much you are absorbing from your diet, since soil content information is rarely available to consumers and other food chemicals may interact with iodine in ways that are not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/vitamins-minerals-and-nutrients/iodine&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here's their advice:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Supplements are the most reliable way to get just the right amount of iodine in your diet.  For example, our VEG1, contains 150 mcg per tablet, which is the adult RDA. If you are worried about overdosing on iodine, try to analyse how much iodine is in the vegetables you eat. This may be possible if you buy your vegetables locally, or some manufacturers may know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Iodized salt is another option, but be careful. Check the label to see exactly how much iodine, and sodium, your table salt contains. For example, your salt may not be iodized at all. Alternatively, you may find just half a teaspoon of table salt contains your RDA.  As little as four teaspoons may contain your daily upper safe intake of iodine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no easy way to know how much iodine is in your food.  Many crops are low in iodine, because they are grown in areas with iodine-deficient soil. Sea vegetables can have too much iodine, and be contaminated with toxins. The BDA says: &amp;quot;do not use seaweed or kelp supplements as an iodine source&amp;quot; because of these uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians recommend that you take a daily iodine supplement, to be confident you are getting just the iodine you need.

Specifically, the &quot;no crystals&quot; part is actually a continuum - all of the machine-free methods produce some amount of crystals, and when buying a machine, you need a complex, well-engineered one to get a low amount of crystals. The lower you get in price, the more likely that your ice cream will have some crystalization. So it is up to you to know which point on the tradeoff line between costs (money, noise, space) and crystals is the best for you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most home cooks opt for a frozen bowl style machine. Mine is from Krups, price currently 55 Euro. When used properly (it really needs the 24 hours prefreezing required in the manual, even if it feels cold enough after a few hours) it turns good recipes into pleasantly smooth ice cream. I must admit that my only attempt at vegan ice cream turned out &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/67860/vegan-ice-cream-has-chalky-texture&quot;&gt;very badly&lt;/a&gt;, but I suspect that this was the recipe's fault. I think that within the cheap class of frozen bowl makers, you still have to buy a higher priced one like mine, since the lower priced ones tend to have negative reviews and test results. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A thing to pay attention to if you are going for a frozen bowl one: in the USA, a very popular option is the Kitchen Aid attachment. Its paddle turns much quicker than that of a machine with its own motor, creating much more overrun. It is up to you to know if this is what you like, or if you want a slow turning one. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically all other methods I know of require a blender with oomph to get anything smooth, because there you first freeze your base solid and then blend it, and a normal blender can't deal with that. You can go the low-tech way to create a granita, but not a sorbet or a vegan icecream. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;freeze whipped cream&quot; method is good for dairy ice creams, so the aquafaba substitute from the other answer is worth a try. My feeling is that it won't allow for the incorporation of much fruit, and of course it has high overrun, but if this is what you like, go for it. Peanut butter should be easy enough to add, and will even decrease overrun. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to worry about cane sugar, icecream is actually easier to make with high fructose sweeteners (and ends up with less crystals). So just use one of those.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="681" LastActivityDate="2017-05-07T14:23:23.670" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Take two steel bowls that fit into each other, with 2 cm or more gap. Find some way to fix them so the small one is within the large one, but hovering above the bottom and centered, to have a consistent gap everywhere. Fill with water (not to the rim) and freeze for 24 hours. If your contraption to hold both is strong enough, the expanding ice will be pushed up and will not cause problems. If it pushes the inner bowl up or something else, try salted water or vodka instead, to work with a liquid coolant. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have your frozen container, pour your chilled base into the inner bowl. Take a baking spatula. It can be silicone, rubber, or stiff (plastic/wood), the important part is for it to mostly fit the bowl's curvature. So only use a straight-sided spatula for a cylindrical or conical bowl. Start stirring with a slow, constant, scraping motion. The base that touches the wall will form a thin frozen layer, and it is your job to remove it from there and let it mix into the middle, while new liquid goes on to the wall. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stop stirring when ready, and fill into the final container. I like using a prefrozen glass box with a snap-on plastic lid. Place it into the freezer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hardest part is to know when to stop. If you stop too soon, the base will still be too liquid, and it will freeze too solid afterwards. If you continue for too long, you will &quot;butter it out&quot; (destroy the emulsion in the base). You have to learn when a given recipe is at its best through trial and error, and stop there. As an orientation value, a standard dairy recipe with about 800 ml base takes 45 min to 60 min of stirring. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a beginner, I will suggest using recipes with sufficient amounts of emulsifier. Creating a good vegan recipe is difficult anyway, since dairy cream and yolks are uniquely suited for good ice cream. Find a recipe which uses emulsifier and sufficient amounts of fat. To be on the safe side, consider starting with boozy styles, like this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidlebovitz.com/grapefruit-campari-sorbet/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;grapefruit campari sorbet&lt;/a&gt; (you can easily replace the cane sugar with another sugar, for example agave syrup). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="681" LastActivityDate="2017-05-07T16:23:21.183" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Chickpea flour has a tendency to clump, so I would recommend pre-mixing the chickpea flour with a small amount of water or non-dairy milk, forming a thick slurry, to get out the clumps before diluting it into the main batter.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="632" LastActivityDate="2017-05-09T21:33:39.307" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

There is a massive migration wave from India for last 100 years or so. These have established vegetarianism food markets, spread cooking styles and dishes in almost every country in world, specially USA. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, recent rise of Indians at world stage whether its science, economics and politics has added to the spread of &quot;Indian&quot; way of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor 2: Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rising health problems is severe concern among high income groups. Although they spend a lot on good food, health problems are not going down. Meat products were severely marketed over plant products before as major source of protein, important for sound growth. However, such myths have been busted. Health practitioners are increasing advocating reduction of red meat consumption to enhance health. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor 3: Business of Vegetarianism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although plant products are cheaper to produce than animal products by several factors, their costs in market are at par with each other. How? There is lot of branding around &quot;organic&quot; going on and they are pushing their products over meat based. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor 4: Spread of Yoga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yoga has been accepted increasingly among world populations, specially higher income groups. Yoga has proven to be productive and has been endorsed by people in variety of fields. There are many among yoga practitioners who are adopting &quot;vegetarianism&quot; form of lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor 5: Spread of Hinduism&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since Vivekananda, there has been growing interest in Hinduism across the world. Currently, several gurus have established centers for spreading Hindu philosophy, including their eating habits and associated whys and whats. Very briefly, food items are divided among &quot;Sattvic, Rajsic and Tamsic&quot; which loosely translates into &quot;Pure&quot;, &quot;Productive&quot; and &quot;Destructive&quot;. Several plants, like onion and garlic, fall under &quot;Destructive&quot; category (and hence are prohibited from consumption among many stricter vegetarians!). Similarly, some animal products fall under &quot;Pure&quot; category, like Milk and Honey. Nevertheless, it does loosely generalise into &quot;plants products are purer than animal products&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor 6 : Global warming, Animal Cruelty, Internet etc&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Raising animals for food contributes significantly to green house gases.

As many have pointed out, this severely affects the way plants feel or suffer, as compared to animals (See this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_perception_(physiology)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_perception_(physiology)&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To generalise your argument, all physical systems or non-living beings exhibit some intelligence so that they prefer stability  (H2 + O into H2O) but resist harm or changes which destablises their present state ( H2O into H2 + O). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, by extension, any form of destruction of nature, living or non-living, calls for moral policing. But then, how do we choose what to consume and what not to? This question, known as Dharma in Hinduism, can be answered both philosophically and scientifically, and the answer would be incomplete without attending to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Food is essential to sustain our lives, and therefore, our lifestyle becomes most important factor to make that selection. What we do, where we live, our culture and philosophies, temporal contexts (like famines!), are few of such factors. Therefore, plants have nothing specific to score over animals here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, why choose plants over animals? I'd ask: why not non living things over plants? or even nothing over something? This question is answered by the simple logic of &quot;minimize destruction&quot; of the present state, as in physics. Consuming nothing is better than consuming something, consuming non living things is better than consuming plants, consuming plants is better than consuming animals, consuming animals is better than consuming humans, and so on. This is because latter exists/survives on top of former, hence consumption of latter will certainly lead to more rapid consumption of resources than former, and therefore faster destruction. We'd reach faster to the stage when our consumption is more than production, by consuming latter than former. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, choosing plants over animals has lot more to do with stability of our system (global warming, health issues etc) than any other factor (animal cruelty, which is more intelligent etc). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="719" LastActivityDate="2017-05-23T09:25:29.933" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Note that this chart unfortunately isn't well referenced (so take it with a grain of salt) but it is the best I could find for a one stop comparison of many foods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As others have pointed out, the most important point is that as long as you aren't eating only the same one or two foods at every meal, you will get enough protein on a vegan diet. Vegetables, potatoes, rice, grains, beans, nuts, seeds, and soy etc. all contain plenty of protein. Some are deficient in one or two amino acids that the others contain, so as long as you eat different things throughout the week you will get enough protein to meet your daily requirements in every amino acid. Note you do not have to mix foods at meals, just have to mix them up throughout the week (as is well documented in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1022507/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;peer-reviewed literature&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*I thought I'd actually try and see how accurate these numbers are, so I checked out, whole foods, and peanut butter is 26g protein per 100g. and 42 g/British pound this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buywholefoodsonline.co.uk/organic-smooth-peanut-butter-100-nuts-meridian-1kg.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;. Its quite expensive at whole foods, but price points at amazon start as low as 2 pounds per kg and the premium brands are mostly around 6 pounds. This puts you in the 40-130g/british bound range. So the numbers in the table seem quite reasonable when doing a quick check. I think this is important given that the list isn't sourced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;**Textured Vegetable protein isn't in the original spreadsheet, but thought I should add it given the other answer. The nutrition info is from whole foods (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buywholefoodsonline.co.uk/textured-vegetable-protein-plain-chunks-tvp-1kg.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) but the price is from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dgrocery&amp;amp;field-keywords=tvp&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;amazon&lt;/a&gt;, because whole foods is notoriously expensive.

That is, as an ethical vegan, you should apparently not be troubled about it in and of itself. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I still look for a reliable suitability label (a trademark of some vegan organisation) as this provides some degree of reassurance that ingredients were not tested on animals and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I don't want to write the issue off so simply; the Vegan Society, for instance, are happy to trademark products that individually meet their standards even though the company makes non-vegan products.

But our excessive use of chemicals sprayed on food and put on water, means that we have less of the bacteria that produce these rare vitamins. I don't have any references on this, so don't take my word for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding plant sources, this page seems to contain well-researched information: &lt;a href=&quot;https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/&lt;/a&gt;.

It may also be possible to find B12 in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2380647/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tempeh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To quote a summary from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/measuring-b12-why-the-confusion/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Inactive B12 analogues in plant foods compromise the accuracy of&#xA;traditional methods used to determine the vitamin B12 amounts and&#xA;activity of a food. Bacterial contamination of a food can create the&#xA;false impression that all such foods contain B12 analogues. The only&#xA;reliable way to determine if a food is a source of active B12 is to&#xA;test various batches of that food to see if it reduces methyl malonic&#xA;acid (MMA) levels in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example, I have a packet of Spirulina that shows in the nutritional information that it contains 170 micrograms of B12 (6800 %NRV) per 100g (the whole packet). And a packet of Chlorella shows 220 micrograms per 100g (8800% RI).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I still cannot recommend people to rely on these sources after reading a bit from that site. I don't have a medical or nutrition background, and I have not read all of it, so I can't make any conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd say, to be on the safe side, take supplements. There are fortified foods, but I can't be sure that I will have them daily so I use B12 liquid which actually tastes good. I can't stand tablets. That just takes a drop under the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, both Spirula and Chrorella have excellent reputation as &amp;quot;superfoods&amp;quot; which are also very rich in protein, so I suppose it's good to include them in a vegan diet anyway, but not as a sole source of B12, for the reasons mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, the world will go vegan soon and we'll have more research into this area. Or perhaps because of the environmental benefits of the plant-based diet, nature will return to its pristine form and we'll get it effortlessly.

Exactly the same algorithm processing exactly the same data from its environment would be running in many, many different environments, e.g. one where it exists on a planet like Earth in a tropical rain forest. In some of these cases the next data it will process will cause suffering due to it being eaten or cut to pieces. But these are unlikely continuations, just like you being awoken due to an asteroid impact and then ending up starving to death in the coming months. In the multiverse this actually happens every day you wake up, but because you have many, many more exact copies in sectors where this doesn't happen, you are unlikely to ever experience this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="480" LastActivityDate="2017-07-13T22:58:26.120" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

For me, I rather think about the person eating it - I feel sorry for them. Most probably they are ignorant about the truths behind what they are eating, no one has shown them the facts or the torture etc. Since this brings out a feeling of compassion in my mind, I think it overshadows the feeling of disgust - plus this thought is powerful for me, so it just does not allow me to think about anything else (and you can invariably think of only one thing at a time).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="530" LastActivityDate="2017-07-20T18:01:21.253" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

But, at the time apparently those people considered it &quot;vegetarian&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, when I first moved to the US, I found large part of the &quot;Vegetarian crowd&quot; as defined in the US, had a mix of Egg &amp;amp; Fish consuming populace in addition to dairy products.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's the time I came across the term Pescatarian.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And as I lived in the US I came across people who were off even dairy and honey etc, even if it was an animal product that did not involve killing or termination of life/ genetic material.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was called the Vegan - Veganism. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the above is a context and viewpoint from generations of original historical vegetarianism.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, given that I lived in the US and the terms and understandings had to be re-termed from my viewpoint to the US viewpoint as my &quot;Vegetarian&quot; - which is how it is still referred to as in India. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, coming to the American/ Western worlds terminology use, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vegan - Plant only&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lacto-Veg - Plant + Dairy (+maybe Honey) = Pure Vegetarian in India&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ovo-Lacto-Veg - + Egg to the above = Eggetarian in India, maybe vegetarian in China (as lot of dishes that Chines call veg contain eggs - We have to caution against those too)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pescatarian - Veg + Fish - No meat (not sure how they are about eggs, mostly yes) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Pesco-veg - Mentioned in Riker's answer is a new one to me, if at all such exists.

What is not good is to use a supplement to correct for a deficiency (except for vitamin D and vitamin B12) and then think that you've plugged all holes in your diet. The essential vitamins, minerals, amino acids,etc. are just the tip of the iceberg; for optimal health a lot more compounds are needed than can be found on any list of RDAs of vitamins, minerals, amino acids and essential fats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We need to consider here that science hasn't yet identified all the compounds our bodies need. E.g. celiac patients who's intestines are so damaged that they need to get supplements via IV, only thrive when given whole food extracts. If they only get a mix of the known nutrients they don't do as well. The difference is then due to the likely large number of compounds in whole foods that has yet to be identified as necessary for the human body. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose that 200 years from now scientists will have identified every last compound you need to eat with their RDAs. If there are 1000 items on that list and today we only have an incomplete list of, say, 25 items with their RDAs, then it's obviously impossible to check if a diet is adequate today. However, there is a statistical trick you can use to guess whether a diet is likely to be deficient according to the unknown list of 1000 compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This works by checking if the 25 compounds in a diet are coming from a wide variety of food sources, here you pay attention to how close different plants are related to each other and also the similarities in the entire profile of the 25 compounds. So, two food sources that are rich in calcium should be considered to be more different if they come from different plants that have different profiles for the other compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose that your diet is not so optimal according to the above criterion, a few of the 25 compounds only come from 3 reasonably independent sources. Then it's a forgone conclusion that your diet will lack many of the 1000 compounds of the unknown list. If you put the compound that comes from the largest number of independent sources on top and below that the compound that comes from the next larger number and so on, then item number 25 of the old list will appear somewhere at the bottom of the new list, but it's likely not going to be the last item of the new list.  So, it's quite likely that you are missing quite a few nutrients that are necessary for optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An effective way to boost the quantity of nutrient intake is to eliminate all sources of empty calories like refined sugars and fats and to get all your calories and essential fats from whole food sources. So, no cooking oil should be used, one should instead eat nuts and seeds. Also, by exercising a lot one can increase the calorie requirement thereby boosting the nutrient intake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="480" LastEditorUserId="480" LastEditDate="2017-10-23T01:47:08.627" LastActivityDate="2017-10-23T01:47:08.627" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This ratio of usable vitamin and so-called analogues is found in many, including animal foods, so it is not a specialty of Spirulina. According to a purely theoretical consideration, it is possible that an excess of analogues can block the uptake and metabolism of the physiological vitamin B12; This theory is neither proved by experiments nor by patient studies. [6] Studies in 1991 and 1999 with children with a vitamin B12 deficit showed that after the administration of spirulina, the blood level of measurable cyanocobalamines increased, but the symptoms did not disappear.

If one or more eggs are taken away by some predators, it lays some more eggs to complete her clutch again. Over hundreds of years forcing hens to endlessly completing their clutch to no avail lead to our modern day hens.

The combination has effects including better conversion of protein, water retention, and it also increases fat retention.

It is true that the overall amino-acid composition differs among these groups, but &lt;strong&gt;with balanced vegetarian diet you can meet the target for each of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_amino_acid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;essential amino-acids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - the stuff from which protein is synthesized. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, in a correspondence from &lt;a href=&quot;http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/105/25/e197.full&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dr McDougall&lt;/a&gt; to AHA (The American Heart Association) it is argued that (emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;..By calculating the amount of each essential amino acid provided by&#xA;  unprocessed complex carbohydrates (starches and vegetables) and&#xA;  comparing these values with those determined by Rose, the results&#xA;  show that &lt;strong&gt;any single one or combination of these plant foods provides&#xA;  amino acid intakes in excess of the recommended requirements&lt;/strong&gt;.&#xA;  Therefore, a careful look at the founding scientific research and some&#xA;  simple math prove &lt;strong&gt;it is impossible to design an amino acid–deficient&#xA;  diet based on the amounts of unprocessed starches and vegetables&#xA;  sufficient to meet the calorie needs of humans&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, mixing&#xA;  foods to make a complementary amino acid composition is unnecessary..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To which AHA itself responds (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;..We certainly agree with Dr McDougall that a &lt;strong&gt;vegetarian diet&lt;/strong&gt; based on&#xA;  the AHA guidelines of 5 to 6 servings of whole grains and 5 or more&#xA;  servings of vegetables and fruit &lt;strong&gt;would, in fact, supply all of the&#xA;  amino acids necessary for health&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;strong&gt;as to pregnancy and vegetarianism in general, there is little else to consider&lt;/strong&gt;, since vegetarian diet does not lack in any specific nutrient as the vegan does (eg. vitamins B12 and D). &lt;strong&gt;Normal recommendations, valid for non-vegetarians, apply.&lt;/strong&gt; A list of these can be easily found in abundance of pregnancy literature and articles, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/vitamins-minerals-supplements-pregnant.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this one from NHS&lt;/a&gt;.

They were also called “journey cakes” as they could be taken on a long journey. The recipe for johnny cakes consisted mainly of cornmeal, hot water, milk, salt, and, if you were lucky, a little bit of sugar. These were also easy to cook over a campfire as they were fried in a pan over an open fire with the bacon drippings from an earlier meal. Here's how to try some for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 cup cornmeal&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;¾ teaspoon salt&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;½ teaspoon sugar&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 cup water&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;½ cup milk&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bacon drippings&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Combine the cornmeal, salt, and sugar in a bowl. Boil the water and then add slowly as you stir the dry ingredients. Add the milk a little at a time to make sure the batter is not too runny. Heat the bacon grease in a cast iron skillet and drop in the batter by the spoonful. Brown on both sides and serve while hot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mrs. Cornelius’s Molasses Apple Pie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As one can imagine, there were few treats to be found in Civil War recipes. Sugar was scarce, but molasses was a very common staple that existed in many kitchens - and it was easy to store and even transport. Even with the war going on, the seasons still changed and crops were still harvested, and one consistent crop was apples. A recipe like this would have been easy for anyone short on ingredients, but wanting to satisfy a sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5 green apples, peeled and sliced&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 teaspoon nutmeg&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 teaspoon cinnamon&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 cup molasses&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Line a pie pan with an uncooked pie crust. Fill with sliced apples, nutmeg, cinnamon, and molasses. Cover with a lattice crust and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Todd Lincoln’s White Cake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the midst of all the bloodshed, life went on at the White House. Abraham Lincoln’s wife, Mary Todd, was a woman who was raised in a affluent family and was accustomed to a rich way of life. In the White House, they had better access to ingredients with which to cook their meals. One of the things Todd loved doing most was entertaining, and she excelled at making sweet things for the White House parties and dinners. One recipe of hers that has been handed down through the years was her famous white cake:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 cup finely chopped almonds&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 cup butter&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2 cups sugar&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3 cups flour&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3 teaspoons baking powder&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 cup milk&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;6 egg whites&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 teaspoon vanilla extract&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Confectionary sugar&#xA;Preheat oven to 350 degrees and grease a round bundt cake pan. Cream the butter and sugar together. Sift the flour and baking powder before adding it to the butter and sugar. Add in the milk and the almonds and mix well. Beat the egg whites until they are stiff and then fold into the batter. Then finally stir in the vanilla extract. Pour into pan and bake for one hour or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Turn out onto a wire rack and cool. Once cooled, sift confectioner’s sugar over it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1096" LastEditorUserId="1096" LastEditDate="2018-11-27T16:28:49.427" LastActivityDate="2018-11-27T16:28:49.427" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Killing disrupts the natural sequence of transmigration and the offender must pay for the karma in a future lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vedas considered meat eating practices to be an act of the uncivilized, since the cow which gives milk is recognized socially as a &quot;mother of human society&quot;. It is considered very cruel to take milk from an animal to kill it at a later time. Thus Yoga societies have based religiosity on the principle of ahimsa or non violence, but more specifically nati-himsa, which means no violence as far as humanly possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1056" LastEditorUserId="164" LastEditDate="2017-11-18T16:07:09.870" LastActivityDate="2017-11-18T16:07:09.870" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

You can easily handle this with the usual vegetarian combo of dairy, eggs and nuts with some vegetable protein sprinkled on top. Just make sure the sources of protein are varied as this increases the likelihood of all of the essential amino acids being present in your food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second point would be mainly about getting &lt;strong&gt;sufficient, if not increased, amounts of Vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt;, which, through its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3405161/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;increase in calcium absorption&lt;/a&gt;, helps to maintain healthy bones. Vitamin D c&lt;strong&gt;an be synthesized by your body from skin exposure to sunlight&lt;/strong&gt;, but, particularly in winter and/or not very sunny places, this is not enough. Food sources vary depending on the type of Vitamin D. D3, which is in general the preferable one, can be found in &lt;strong&gt;eggs&lt;/strong&gt; and that's basically it for veg*n sources. However, D2 is to be found in some &lt;strong&gt;mushrooms&lt;/strong&gt; and is used to fortify a lot of vegan (and perhaps vegetarian) food as well. However, be wary of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D#Effect_of_excess&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Vitamin D caused hypercalcimia&lt;/a&gt; as this can have some serious adverse effects on your body (we are talking about huge doses here though). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the last point, this can be influenced by &lt;strong&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18505499&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Vitamin C is helpful in collagen synthesis&lt;/a&gt;, which, as mentioned before, makes most of the organic part of your bones. At this point, I would also add a &quot;not only&quot; to that statement, as collagen makes up a lot of things in your body and the effects of its improper synthesis due to the Vitamin C deficiency once caused sailors rather big problems. You may have heard of it being called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;scurvy&lt;/a&gt;. So you want the exact opposite of that and that means a lot of Vitamin C. &lt;strong&gt;Almost any fruit and vegetable there is will add some Vitamin C into your system&lt;/strong&gt;, but fruits are generally better in this regard, with the top picks being citrus and berry fruits along with tropical ones like mango, watermelon and papaya. And the best part is that, unlike with Vitamin D, there is no risk of hypervitaminosis from Vitamin C; any excess Vitamin C you ingest will be excreted in urine eventually (but very high doses can cause temporary diarrhea).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Honourable mentions are also &lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Potassium&lt;/strong&gt;. Iron helps keep your red blood cells in good shape and delivering the much needed oxygen to the injured tissues so that it heals faster. Potassium helps keep the calcium you digested in your body for longer by stopping you peeing out so much of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think I should also mention &lt;strong&gt;what you should not do&lt;/strong&gt; as there are things that can have a negative effect on your bones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest no-no is probably &lt;strong&gt;excessive salt intake&lt;/strong&gt;, since sodium actually weakens your bones by decalcifying them. &lt;strong&gt;Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/osteoporosis/features/alcohol&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;many adverse effects&lt;/a&gt; on your bones as well and so it would be a good idea to abstain from it while you recover.

There is also stated&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;1 litre of rennet extract contains approximately 1,000 mg of enzymes&#xA;  and 18% of table salt. The rest is just water. For the processing of&#xA;  10,000 litres of milk into 1 ton of cheese approximately 2 kg of&#xA;  liquid rennet extract is needed. This means: 2 grams of natural&#xA;  enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;20% to 30% of theses enzymes remain in the cheese, the rest goes into&#xA;  the whey and is completely destroyed by the drying process of the&#xA;  whey-powder-production.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There is only approximately 0,5 grams of enzymes remaining in 1 ton of&#xA;  cheese. This means: 0,5 ppm (parts per million). 1 kg of cheese&#xA;  contains therefore 0,0000005 g rennet enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;On the other side: for the production of 1.900 kg of cheese (19.000&#xA;  litres of milk) 1 cow and 2,7 calves have been killed: this means:&#xA;  approx. 0,375 kg (dead cow) for 1 kg of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the 0,0000005g per 1kg figure is in contrast with much bigger (by three orders of magnitude) 0,0003g per 1kg which I have found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennet#Modern_method&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; (although unsourced). I will leave for everyone to decide themselves whether this undermines the validity of the above statements or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, the contents of animal rennet in cheese are probably not that big and could be written off as unconsequential not worth worrying about.

Although the gospel was said to be used by &quot;Ebionites&quot; during the time of the early church, the identity of the group or groups that used it remains a matter of conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this is what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebionites&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; on Ebionites say:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Ebionites (Greek: Ἐβιωναῖοι Ebionaioi, derived from Hebrew אביונים ebyonim, ebionim, meaning &quot;the poor&quot; or &quot;poor ones&quot;), is a patristic term referring to a Jewish Christian movement that existed during the early centuries of the Christian Era. They regarded Jesus of Nazareth as a prophet while rejecting his divinity, his virgin birth, and insisted on the necessity of following Jewish law and rites. They used only one of the Jewish–Christian gospels, the hebrew book of Matthew starting at chapter 3, revered James the brother of Jesus (James the Just), and rejected Paul the Apostle as an apostate from the Law. Their name suggests that they placed a special value on voluntary poverty. Ebionim was one of the terms used by the sect at Qumran that sought to separate themselves from the corruption of the Temple. Many believe that they were Essenes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;hr&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Yet some Church Fathers describe some Ebionites as departing from traditional Jewish principles of faith and practice. For example, Epiphanius of Salamis stated that the Ebionites engaged in excessive ritual bathing,possessed an angelology which claimed that the Christ is a great archangel who was incarnated in Jesus and adopted as the son of God, &lt;strong&gt;opposed animal sacrifice&lt;/strong&gt;, denying parts or most of the Law, &lt;strong&gt;and practiced Jewish vegetarianism&lt;/strong&gt;, and celebrated a commemorative meal annually, on or around Passover, with unleavened bread and water only, in contrast to the daily Christian Eucharist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;hr&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In the Gospel of the Ebionites, as quoted by Epiphanius, &lt;strong&gt;John the Baptist and Jesus are portrayed as vegetarians&lt;/strong&gt;. Epiphanius states that the Ebionites had amended &quot;locusts&quot; (Greek akris) to &quot;honey cake&quot; (Greek ekris). This emendation is not found in any other New Testament manuscript or translation, though a different vegetarian reading is found in a late Slavonic version of Josephus' War of the Jews.Pines (1966) and others propose on the contrary that the Ebionites were projecting their own vegetarianism onto John the Baptist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, Ebionites were strictly vegetarians, opposed animal sacrifice and believed Jesus Christ to be an advocate of animal rights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of Ebionites has seven surviving fragments. I will quote the ones that show Christ to be a vegetarian and an advocate of animal rights:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Jesus said] &quot;I am come to abolish the sacrifices&lt;/strong&gt;: if ye cease not from sacrificing, the wrath (of God) will not cease from weighing upon you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;hr&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[The disciples said,] &quot;Where wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the Passover?&quot; To which He replied: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;I have no desire to eat the flesh of this Paschal Lamb with you.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can read the remaining fragments &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Gospel_of_the_Ebionites&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: I am not talking about other religions since my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/users/128/nog-shine&quot;&gt;Nog Shine&lt;/a&gt; has written a comprehensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/questions/98/do-any-major-religions-promote-or-require-a-vegetarian-diet/143#143&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt;.

Some back of the envelope math says farms would have to charge something like 4 times the price of normal eggs to raise hens and not slaughter older hens. If we simplify the problem by assuming egg production halts instead of slows, and older hens take the same amount of resources as younger hens to sustain, we get:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                               age_hens_live_to&#xA;cost_of_cruelty_free_eggs = cost_of_eggs × ------------------------&#xA;                                           age_egg_production_halts&#xA;&#xA;                                           9&#xA;                          ≈ cost of eggs × -&#xA;                                           2&#xA;&#xA;                          ≈ cost of eggs × 4.5&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since most people don't care that hens are slaughtered, they would opt for the cheaper eggs, and the very small population that would buy cruelty-free eggs (even many vegans would still be opposed to this) wouldn't be enough for such a farm to be viable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My model for the cost of eggs is very primitive, but see &lt;a href=&quot;https://nelliesfreerange.com/faqs/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this FAQ&lt;/a&gt; from an egg brand (in the US) that markets themselves as having humane practices and claims to love their hens. Specifically look at the question &quot;What happens to the hens when they are too old to lay eggs?&quot;. They estimate that they would have to charge about 12.00 $ per carton of eggs, which is indeed about 4 times the current price of eggs in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've never heard of a cruelty free egg farm in the US, and I think this is the reason for it.

There can, however, be some approximation by looking at other huge &lt;em&gt;organisations&lt;/em&gt; (such as religions) which do at times promote such bans. There is also the possibility of answering based on speculations with basic human psychology and precedents. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;religion angle&lt;/strong&gt;. While religious organisations have arguably smaller executive power than governments these days, their impact on human behaviour is still profound and the effectiveness of a ban of anything demanded by religion might meet with more success and less resistance, merely because of the devotion thing. Luckily, both for the purposes of this answer and for the lives of countless animals, there is a major religion that promotes this. Hinduism. While &lt;strong&gt;vegetarianism is not required in Hinduism per se&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;principle of nonviolence&lt;/a&gt; is an integral part of the teaching and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QrHPXSP1z-AC&amp;amp;pg=PA99&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;an estimated 30%&lt;/a&gt; of Hindus are vegetarians&lt;/strong&gt;. Pretty good numbers, considering that it is not even required, as compared to outright banned. While some non-Hindus are also vegetarians, Hinduism and other traditional Indian philosophies can be argued to be the biggest factors in making India the country with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;largest number of vegetarians in the world&lt;/a&gt;, both in percentage and numbers (in the reference, there is the Brazil entry claiming some pretty big claims, but it is unquoted and likely misleading). As for the second part of your question, the positive impact of this on the animals, well, it sort of follows.. Less people eating animals = Less animal death. Less animal death = positive impact on animals, since they don't die that much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;precedents based, psychological angle&lt;/strong&gt;. Another way of looking at this and trying to determine the answer can be based on similar past bans of stuff popular among population. In general, when something is banned, there is a negative external pressure on your motivation to seek it out. Whether you still seek it out is therefore based almost solely on the strength of your internal motivation. Let's take a look at one of the precedents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While using a methodology that can be argued against, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nber.org/papers/w3675&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;NBER estimation of the alcohol consumption during Prohibition&lt;/a&gt; shows some interesting trends. The alcohol consumption fell sharply to 30% of pre-Prohibition levels in the beginning. This tells us that approximately 30% of population had an internal motivation strong enough to ignore the ban from the very beginning. Arguably, these would for example be the alcohol addicts or the adamant Prohibition/government opposers. The remaining 70% was a mixture of people with little or no internal motivation to breach the ban, eg. occasional drinkers and people who had some levels of internal motivation, but which were sufficiently affraid of the punishment that would follow the breach. After the initial sharp decline, when the murky waters of '&lt;em&gt;how strict this ban is anyway?&lt;/em&gt;' were sufficiently explored, the consumption rose to 60-70% of the pre-Prohibition levels. Merely by probing the strength of the ban and after the whole Prohibition economy blossomed and became sort of a public secret, some people found it beneficial enough to ignore the ban and go back to drinking. After the Prohibition ended, the levels eventually (not immediately though) rose back to the pre-Prohibition levels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, to draw some lines back to the animal slaughter ban from all this, there is a couple of variables to consider. There is the &lt;strong&gt;addictivness&lt;/strong&gt; one, with alcohol having an upper hand here as a certain percentage of population ignored ban simple because they were not able to do otherwise. If animal slaughter ban were to be enforced, there would probably be much smaller number of people having this problem, if any. Then there is the &lt;strong&gt;popularity&lt;/strong&gt; one. Both alcohol and meat are popular enough, although the meat has undeniably bigger audience. It is ingrained in most of the cultures in a way that alcohol can hardly ever be. Alcohol and meat 1:1 so far. From the &lt;strong&gt;health&lt;/strong&gt; point of view, alcohol is a clear loser - what is interesting though is that, nonetheless, people actively looked for ways of consuming alcohol even after it was banned, even though it was detrimental to their health. The ban therefore did not have much impact on the public perception of the intrinsic reasons for the ban itself. If meat was to be banned, the environmental and ethical aspects of the ban would therefore likely to be ignored just about the same as before the ban, &lt;em&gt;at least for the beginning&lt;/em&gt;. More on that later. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could continue for quite some time, but let's be concise. I &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt; if a meat ban was to be imposed today by government in one of most of the countries, it would &lt;strong&gt;initially follow a similar path to that of alcohol during Prohibition&lt;/strong&gt;. A sharp decline in consumption, based on initial fear of punishment, followed by a steady increase as the illegal economy seizes the opportunity and the borders of acceptable are probed. I believe, however, that the ban would see the meat-eating percentage of population reduce much more than the 30% that we saw during Prohibition, simply because of the non-addictivness of meat. The increase would also be smaller (it doubled with alcohol, it could easily double here too, but smaller number doubled is.. a smaller number). The &lt;strong&gt;final outcome&lt;/strong&gt; (which for Prohibition was an end and the return to the previous state) would largely depend on two things. The &lt;strong&gt;reason for government to issue such a ban&lt;/strong&gt; - it would be possible to assume that there was already a public pressure on the government to do so, as there is very little incentive for it to ban it otherwise - and the &lt;strong&gt;length of the duration of the ban&lt;/strong&gt; - the longer the ban would be in place (say a couple of decades as opposed to a couple of years/decade) the more profound and longer lasting would its impact on the meat-eating be. Generally, people are surprised with how easy and natural the transition to vegetarianism/veganism is. If they were legislated into it, it could eventually become part of the social norm and eating meat would then be largely perceived as wrong. The ban would eventually transform the legal issue into a moral issue and that is much more likely to last, even if the ban was overturned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, the positive impact part of your question seems apparent to me and I won't go into it here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of this is, of course, speculation, but it is one that I wanted to make. It is possible that your question will get closed as unanswerable, since it basically is, but it opens up an interesting debate.

Using common sense and putting a bit of effort into finding out stuff might be a better alternative. Initially, you would have to Google things to be 100% sure, or perhaps you can search for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ilovevegan.com/resources/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;vegan blog&lt;/a&gt; that focuses on beggining vegans and tells you about the most common pitfalls and so on. An &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ilovevegan.com/resources/building-a-healthy-vegan-grocery-list/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;example grocery list&lt;/a&gt; from the same blog. I personally did not use this blog so cannot attest to its quality, but I provide it more as an example - any good vegan blog will do :).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since you asked this in comments - what I did when I turned vegan was.. nothing much. I was a long time vegetarian before that and I basically just switched milk for soy milk, stopped eating and buying cheese and just continued not buying eggs since I never liked them anyway. These things constituted about 90% of my non-veganism and were my main focus when I was turning vegan. The remaining 10% were non-vegan ingredients in preprocessed foods. This one does get tricky at times as milk and eggs seem to be ubiquitous in these foods at times. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to deal with this trickiness is to check for vegan label. If you do not know how this works in your country, either look on the internet or ask a question here, although we do have some good answers here already (&lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/questions/489/how-to-identify-a-vegan-supplement&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/questions/898/what-is-the-standard-way-for-conveying-vegan-and-vegetarian-as-separate-icons&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/questions/279/are-there-certification-labels-that-ensure-a-product-is-really-vegan&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). Also, if I remember correctly from one of your other questions, you are from India - if that is the case, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/questions/1137/are-there-any-countries-besides-india-where-it-is-mandatory-to-mark-food-product&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; might be of interest to you. You are in luck, as in India the labels are even there to distinguish if something is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian_and_non-vegetarian_marks&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;lacto-vegetarian or non-lacto-vegetarian&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is no label at all, you can check the ingredients list yourself. Milk and eggs are allergens and in some countries (eg. the UK, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/multimedia/pdfs/publication/allergy-leaflet.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;since 12/2014&lt;/a&gt;) they are required to be printed in bold/italic and so on. This should eliminate the most obvious culprits. Checking alergens list (if separate) is also a good idea, just in case. If a product is vegan though (and not accidentally vegan), the company is usually proud to put that on the packaging. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do sometimes &lt;em&gt;cheat&lt;/em&gt; my veganism when it comes to trace ingredients in products that have no alternatives (or the alternatives are beyond my means). The way I see it, my veganism is not about never eating another particle of animal product again - it is about reducing this to the possible/comfortable minimum because of the societal and economical pressures this creates that then mirror themselves in the well-being and ethical appreciation of animals.

An ultrasound can show the gestational sac as early as three weeks after conception (the fifth week of the pregnancy). Using a transvaginal ultrasound, the gestational sac can be detected up to a week earlier. The fetus itself can usually be detected a week later, and the fetal heartbeat, while not audible on a fetal doppler, can be seen as a flutter on the ultrasound around 6.5 weeks into the pregnancy. While there is delay compared to when a dip-stick style test &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; detect the human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) hormone, which might be able to detect the hCG during the second week of the pregnancy (almost a week before the expected period), it is very reliable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a dip-stick method detects a pregnancy, the next step is usually an ultrasound anyway.

This is how eggs give baked goods structure, their protein network. Other food products that provide structure by forming polymer networks include gluten, pectin, and something in flaxseed (unfortunately, I'm not sure what exactly). Of those three, flaxseed gives a structure most similar to that of eggs, but it needs to cool back down before the structure fully forms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When eggs are whipped, they form small bubble of air. When these bubbles are heated, they expand, which causes some expansion. The amount of leavening caused by eggs in most baking recipes however, is insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eggs provide some liquid to recipes, which affects the consistency of the batter a little. Additionally, they provide some fats, which hinders gluten formation, and stops baked goods from becoming tough. In recipes without a source of fat besides eggs, some oil may need to be added.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, eggs act as an emulsifier, which means they prevent mixtures of water and oil from separating. In most baked goods recipes, this doesn't matter, because batter will not separate anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because baking recipes usually rely on the structure provided by eggs much more than any of the other properties, flaxseed meal usually makes a good substitute for eggs in baking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1250" LastEditorUserId="1250" LastEditDate="2018-01-31T22:59:03.653" LastActivityDate="2018-01-31T22:59:03.653" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This still occurs in many cultures and there is plenty of anthropological, archaeological, and molecular evidence that we were scavengers as well and hunter-gatherers during our evolutionary and even recent history. Many indigenous people still live off the land all over the world and often a key component of their values and beliefs is the inherent value of lives including animals. There are many cultural practices in which as many parts of the animal is used to reduce waste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main reason that this no longer occurs widely would likely be yield. As the population has soared, there’s been an increasing need to industrialise. This has especially been important with plant products and food crops with the need to provide food such as staple crops to feed a growing population. It also occurs with animals. We simply cannot find enough plant or animal products by scavenging (or even hunting) to meet the demand of our society. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main reason that we have selectively bred domesticated crops and animals is to meet this demand. Many domesticated species are still used in favour or higher quality or more desirable varieties (in other traits) because the exisiting farmed varieties have been bred for centuries to provide higher yields. This is why particular strains are farmed while others are not and are still less desirable when the die of natural causes, even if the quality isn’t compromised (in the case tough meat in old age or roadkill).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This most notably occurs in plant survives such as the larger seeds in wheat, corn, and fruits. These produce larger food crops which are more durable during transport or storage. It also occurs in livestock where domesticated species produce far higher yields of wool and milk or grow faster, have higher fecundity (twins or larger litters), and grow more flesh for meat yields.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There’s also the “cringe” factor. Many people would not use their deceased pets to make food or clothing for example. Similarly, people in industrialised societies (with better options) would usually not consume roadkill unless in extreme poverty or starvation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="159" LastActivityDate="2018-02-23T03:31:16.783" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Ammonia is made by reacting nitrogen from the air with hydrogen, which may be produced from water or from hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons include fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. While coal is derived from ancient plant matter, oil and gas are ultimately made from the bodies of sea creatures that decomposed under intense heat and pressure. Calcium carbonate is found in the ground as limestone. This is partly made from the fossilized bones and shells of dead animals. Therefore, it is possibly debatable whether ammonia (also used to make ammonium chloride) and calcium chloride should be considered vegan, but in general practise, &lt;strong&gt;they are considered vegan and used by vegans&lt;/strong&gt;.

One about safety of fermentation, the other about how to make rice mylk (safely). While I cannot answer the latter I can answer the former.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The difference between fermentation and spoilage is about control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With spoilage random species of micro organisms (bacteria or fungi) make up the majority of those processing the food. This often leads to them producing toxins or poorly tasting chemicals. Lactic acid produced by the Lactobacillus family being a really common example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fermentation is different however, in that you create the conditions in which a desired species of micro organism (or group of them) can thrive and overwhelm any others that produce undesired results. There are many possible relevant conditions, but almost always relevant are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;temperature&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;acidity&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;oxygen level&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;nutrients present (e.g. kinds of carbo hydrates and proteins)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;chemicals that &quot;bind&quot; water (e.g. sugar and lots of salts)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming of other micro organisms is actually what makes fermentation suitable as a preservation technique in a lot of foods. In specific cases it can work much better than cooling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now about rice specifically: it contains a lot of carbo hydrates. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rice&amp;amp;oldid=830360105#Nutrition&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;According to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Cooked, unenriched, white, long-grained rice is composed of 68% water, 28% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and negligible fat (table).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is almost perfect for any kind of micro organism. Left to itself after cooking it and keeping it around too long this leads to a lot of different kinds growing in there. The species that will end up &quot;winning&quot; usually are those performing chemical warfare: i.e. poisoning the food for the competition. Unfortunately the toxins they use to fight each other tend to be pretty effective at making us, humans and most other animals, sick too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well done fermentation avoids this. Some common signs of bad fermentation are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;bad smells&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;bad taste&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;lumps and increases in viscosity&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;unexpected changes in color&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So whatever you end up doing: try to know the intended result before consuming it. If it does not match that you're at risk if consuming it. If it does match your expectations your risk is significantly lower, but still not zero.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally try to make sure the tools you use are really clean, preferably as close to sterile as you can get them. The food industry commonly uses 70% ethanol alcohol for this purpose: it kills almost everything.

While there are no proven natural wholefood sources of B12 that are vegan, it's possible that some people obtain small quantities of B12 from unrecognised or incidental sources (since B12 is produced by soil bacteria) while others do not, so it's probably impossible to predict for a given individual how long it will take for them to develop a deficiency. B12 is stored in the liver and apparently husbanded very carefully by the body.

A very small number of individuals with no obvious reliable source appear to avoid clinical deficiency symptoms for twenty years or more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll include a couple of personal anecdotes. When I became vegan, I had been an ovo-lacto vegetarian for around 15 years already, and had gradually cut most dairy products from my diet. I started to experience disordered sleep patterns that I realised might possibly be related to B12 only a few months after going vegan, although I was regularly eating Marmite (worth noting here that the serving size of yeast extract typically eaten is not sufficient, and some yeast extract spreads are not fortified with B12 at all). I started taking strong B12 supplements, and the symptoms went away (of course, they might have been caused by something else). My mum, who went (lacto-ovo) vegetarian two and a half years ago, recently mentioned to me, after a few months of me cooking vegan food for her nearly every day, that her hands and feet were &quot;itchy&quot;. I immediately felt guilty because I knew this was a B12 deficiency symptom and I hadn't made her aware that people following a plant-based diet need more than the occasional slice of marmite-y toast to maintain healthy B12 status. She started taking B12 supplements, and the symptoms went away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me, that if your B12 status is poor (you have had a low-level deficiency for a long time), deficiency symptoms may appear quickly when your intake reduces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, please be aware that &lt;strong&gt;B12 deficiency is serious even before symptoms occur&lt;/strong&gt; and that symptoms are subtle and may easily be mistaken for something else, or for general malaise. By the time your hands and feet start tingling (if that happens), while you are still feeling well, &lt;strong&gt;irreversible nerve damage has already occurred&lt;/strong&gt;. If you become pregnant, and your B12 status is poor but asymptomatic, you may have pregnancy complications. Poor B12 status (with no obvious symptoms) increases the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="74" LastActivityDate="2018-03-21T13:33:15.220" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Let's start by quantifying the nutritional content of one large (50 gram) egg.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 6.3 grams&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cholesterol: 186 mg&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol): 44 IU&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Iron: 0.6 mg&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And we want to get all this within an energy budget of 77 kcal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's start with macronutrients because those are bounded by hard limits on energy. We know that protein provides 4 kcal per gram, so one egg provides 25 kcal energy from protein, or about 33%. To meet the protein goal we'll need to identify a food that meets or exceeds 33% energy from protein. Most whole plant foods are lower than that, but I happen to know that nutritional yeast provides 50% energy from protein, we can use 12 grams of nutritional yeast to provide 6.4 grams of protein in 45 kcal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll skip right past cholesterol because there are no vegan foods that provide it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, aka &quot;the sunshine vitamin&quot;) is not found in most plants, although it is found in lichens! Most people are unable or unwilling to eat lichen however, so vitamin D3 can be obtained from a supplement. A single &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vegetology.com/vitashine-1000iu-tablets&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;tablet&lt;/a&gt; provides 1000 IU, so one tablet provides as much D3 as 22 large eggs. Or if you'd rather not purchase a supplement, you can get vitamin D3 by exposing your skin to sunshine. Going outside in the midday sun in summertime in light clothing will produce about 1000 IU per minute, so you would need just 3 seconds of sun exposure to get the same amount of vitamin D3 as from one large egg. If you're okay with Vitamin D2 instead of D3 (good, but maybe not &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; good) then you can get it from mushrooms, although the concentration varies too much for me to provide a quantity recommendation. And if you're okay getting your D2 from fortified foods, then you can get 44 IU from 105 grams of &lt;a href=&quot;https://silk.com/products/unsweetened-original-almondmilk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;unsweetened almond milk&lt;/a&gt; in just 13 kcal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The desired amount of iron is already provided by the quantity of nutritional yeast mentioned above. Other high sources of iron are spinach (make sure it's cooked!!) and other leafy greens. Legumes (such as lentils) are also a source of iron. But we don't need those for answering this question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with a &lt;strong&gt;final answer&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;12 grams (1.5 tbsp) nutritional yeast - 45 kcal&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;105 grams unsweetened, fortified almond milk - 13 kcal&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This combination of foods provides the nutrients you're looking for, and does it with 25% less calories (58 kcal) than chicken eggs (77 kcal).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some nutritional differences that you did not mention as priorities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The nooch/milk combo is much richer in B vitamins (like 100x more)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Only &lt;em&gt;fortified&lt;/em&gt; nutritional yeast provides vitamin B12. If fortified, it provides B12 in excess of what an egg provides.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The vegan combo provides more of your daily folate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The egg provides more Vitamin A, and it does so in a different form (as retinol)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The vegan combo provides more Vitamin E (from the almond milk)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Both eggs and nutritional yeast are a complete protein&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The eggs provide saturated fat, while the vegan has none&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The vegan combo provides less fat overall&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The almond milk provides much more calcium than the egg&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The vegan combo provides more potassium&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The nutritional yeast provides much more zinc&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to determine the most palatable way to eat 1.5 tbsp of nooch and a half cup of plant-based milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Yes, there is at least one combination of vegan foods that mirrors (or exceeds) the nutritional value of an egg.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1236" LastActivityDate="2018-03-29T20:07:36.607" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

They may also be expensive compared to dairy cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recipes for &quot;vegan cheese&quot; often use cashews and/or other nuts. These tend to have a soft, creamy or crumbly texture, similar to some soft fresh cheeses. If a lower fat, higher protein replacement is required, tofu, especially if slightly fermented, may serve as a replacement in some contexts, for example in curries. Tofu can also be thoroughly crumbled and combined with, for example, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, and salt to make a reasonable substitute for ricotta. Nutritional yeast adds an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;umami&lt;/a&gt; taste that assists in producing a &quot;cheesy&quot; taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cheesy-tasting sauces can be made, for example from potato or squash, nut butters and nutritional yeast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/questions/444/is-there-a-vegan-cheese-i-can-use-for-pizzas&quot;&gt;Is there a vegan cheese I can use for pizzas?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Yogurt&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yogurt is made by introducing a culture of certain strains of bacteria to milk which has been heated to prevent curdling and then cooled so as not to kill the bacteria, and allowing fermentation to occur, breaking down the milk sugar (lactose) into lactic acid to give a mildly sour/tangy taste and creating a thick, creamy texture.

The reference profile is generated by dividing the EAR for each amino acid by the overall EAR for protein (0.66 g/kg/d). If the reference profile was computed by dividing amino acid RDA by total protein RDA the results would be very similar.

Note however, that because the EAR for amino acids is variable on several factors (eg. age, body composition) the definition of a complete protein is also variable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Complete Nutrition with Incomplete Proteins&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even the so-called incomplete proteins can provide all essential amino acids in sufficient quantities, provided a larger amount of food is consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, lentils (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cronometer.com/printfood.html?name=Lentils%252C%2BRaw&amp;amp;food=687&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;USDA SR28 Food #16069&lt;/a&gt;) is considered an incomplete protein because it has a lower methionine+cysteine (sulfur-containing amino acids, or SAA) content (21.6 mg/g) than the reference protein (25 mg/g). However, lentils alone could satisfy the SAA requirement if the total protein obtained from lentils was 16% higher than the total protein requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the example of a 70 kg person. The RDA for total protein would be 88 grams (based on 0.80 g/kg) and the RDA for SAA would be 1.33 grams. The SAA requirement could be met by consuming 900 kcal worth of lentils. Therefore even lentils in isolation, which are commonly considered an incomplete protein, can satisfy all amino acid requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For further reading, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Medicine publishes a freely-available book about dietary reference intakes for various nutrients, and this book contains &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;179 pages&lt;/a&gt; about protein and amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1236" LastActivityDate="2018-04-14T22:49:11.617" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It means that these animals are forcibly bred (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ps/article/93/12/2970/2730506&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;often selectively&lt;/a&gt;, making animals unable to support their own weights because of the maximization of muscle as a result of that) and forced to watch their offspring going through the exact same thing. Well, they usually never really see their offspring because it is taken from them as soon as possible so yeah, there is that. There is no escape for these animals and even if there was, they have been so deformed by humanity's farming practices that their chances for survival without humans are.. slim.

Since healthy animals ovulate without intervention, and chickens do not make use of their unfertilised eggs, there is no obvious actual harm caused by using hen's eggs that are acquired incidentally from free hens. It may be the case that the kept hens have been rescued and would not be safe in the wild, and in such a scenario there might seem to be no ethical objection to eating the eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some vegans go on to consider the implications of selling eggs obtained that way. This is objected to as it is seen as &lt;em&gt;using the animal as means to an end&lt;/em&gt; (obtaining money), though I am not sure how much more so selling is such &quot;use&quot; compared to eating yourself. A vegan who, for aesthetic reasons (disgust or distaste towards all animal-derived ingredients) does not want to eat the eggs, had better give them away freely. Then, not benefiting personally in any way from the use of the hen, they have not broken their own code... Still, giving, or selling eggs to people who would otherwise obtain them could be seen as &lt;em&gt;creating or maintaining a market or demand&lt;/em&gt; for eggs, which can only be obtained according to these ethical standards in very small quantities. Since this &quot;ethical&quot; source cannot supply the entire market, it would be better for there not to be such a market.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are some of the arguments usually made around this topic, one on which individual vegans take different positions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="74" LastEditorUserId="74" LastEditDate="2018-04-18T06:52:48.603" LastActivityDate="2018-04-18T06:52:48.603" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Although some rectal gas is due to the ingestion of air, the majority of flatulence is produced from bacterial fermentation. The byproducts of this degradation are hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, and sometimes sulfur, depending upon the bacteria. Normal intestinal processes move these gases out of the body in the form of flatus.

The principal gas accountable for the increased flatus volume is carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beans can (and are) processed in various ways to reduce the amount of flatus produced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fermenting soybeans to produce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/soy-alert/soy-carbohydrates-the-flatulence-factor/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;natto and tempeh&lt;/a&gt; greatly reduces oligosaccharides.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tofu has most (but not all) of the oligosaccharides removed, so that it causes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/soy-alert/soy-carbohydrates-the-flatulence-factor/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;less gas&lt;/a&gt; than eating an equivalent number of soybeans directly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, yes a vegan diet is very probably associated with a higher volume of flatulence due to the increased inclusion of beans, although results are likely to vary between individuals and even over time for a particular individual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1236" LastActivityDate="2018-04-23T20:49:13.337" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It is preferable that the first insulating layer (closest to skin) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tactics.com/info/layering-for-the-weather&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;should not be cotton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, synthetic materials performed better than natural fibres in this area. One popular option is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thermore.com/en/insulation-for-outerwear-products/ecodown/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Thermore Ecodown&lt;/a&gt; which is made from recycled PET plastic fibres. Another well regarded option is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.primaloft.com/insulation&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Primaloft Eco&lt;/a&gt;. In either case, insulating materials are not likely to be in direct contact with skin so health concerns about endocrine disrupters are minimized. Of course there are still possible concerns about production, washing, and disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Outerwear/Shell&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hemp finally makes an appearance here. The Amsterdam-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hoodlamb.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Hoodlamb&lt;/a&gt; company is making all-vegan clothing that uses a mix of hemp and organic cotton to create a water-resistant outer shell. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wullyouterwear.ca/products/doe-parka&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wully Outerwear&lt;/a&gt; doesn't say what their Vegantech shell is made of, but I'm fairly certain it's a synthetic material.

My reading of the research on this matter is that the main area of concern is not the consumption of soy itself. It is the consumption of genetically modified soy that is resistant to &quot;Roundup&quot; - the most widely used herbicide globally, of which the main active ingredient is glyphosate. This is toxic and carcinogenic, and worryingly, the additives (adjuvants) commonly used with it are even more toxic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe the link between soy and birth defects originated with 2010 Rusian language animal study by Surov and colleagues, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-smith/genetically-modified-soy_b_544575.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;widely reported on at the time&lt;/a&gt; and found a strong link between GMO soy consumption and birth defects (and tumor development) in rats over 2 years. However, I found no information about peer review, or details about the study design. It cannot be found on PubMed or Google Scholar, and so it is difficult to give much weight to this study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.005.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Séralini et al (2012)&lt;/a&gt; looked at genetically modified corn, where where 3 groups of 10 hamsters were studied over a period of 2 years, and also found results confirming the link . This attracted enormous attention at the time, and several eminent biologists and statisticians including Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter were &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-gmcrops-safety/study-on-monsanto-gm-corn-concerns-draws-skepticism-idUKBRE88J0MS20120920&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;deeply critical&lt;/a&gt; of the methods used.

It was subsequently &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12302-014-0014-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;re-published in 2014&lt;/a&gt; in Environmental Sciences Europe, again to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-republication-of-seralini-study-on-roundup-tolerant-gm-maize/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;much criticism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, as to the current status of the literature on the subject, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12889-016-3153-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;De Araujo et al (2016)&lt;/a&gt; conducted a systematic review of studies investigating the link between pesticides and birth defects and concluded:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Current epidemiological evidence, albeit limited to a few studies using non-quantitative and indirect&#xA;  estimates and dichotomous analysis of exposures, does not lend support to public concerns that glyphosate-based&#xA;  pesticides might pose developmental risks to the unborn child. Nonetheless, owing to methodological limitations&#xA;  of existing analytical observational studies, and particularly to a lack of a direct measurement (urine and/or blood&#xA;  levels), or an indirect estimation of exposure that has proven valid, these negative findings cannot be taken as&#xA;  definitive evidence that GLY, at current levels of occupational and environmental exposures, brings no risk for&#xA;  human development and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1080/10937404.2012.632361&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Williams et al (2012)&lt;/a&gt; conducted a critical review of existing studies on the link between birth defects and glyphosate and found:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;no consistent effects of glyphosate exposure on reproductive health or the developing offspring&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for hypospadia in particular, Carmichael et al (2013) found a protective effect from phytoestrogens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To sum up, there is insufficient evidence of a link between GMO soy and birth defects in humans despite some animal studies confirming the link and the World Health Organisation classifying glyphosate as &quot;probably carcinogenic to humans&quot;. One explanation for this is that animals are fed massive amounts of the substance being studied, but humans have such relatively low exposure. A recent article by Avila-Vazquez et al (2018) looked at the rate of birth defects in an agricultural town in Argentina in the heart of the GMO soy and corn growing areas found:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The spontaneous abortion and congenital abnormalities rates are three and two times higher than the national average reported by the national health (10% vs. 3% and 3% - 4.3% vs 1.4% respectively)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short: it appears that there is very little to worry about at the present time, unless:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You live on GMO soy, or&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You live in an area where GMO soy is grown extensively.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Avila-Vazquez, M. , Difilippo, F. , Lean, B. , Maturano, E. and Etchegoyen, A.

Real food tends to be on the outer edge of the store near the loading docks, where it can be replaced with fresh foods when it goes bad.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don't eat anything that won't eventually rot. &quot;There are exceptions -- honey -- but as a rule, things like Twinkies that never go bad aren't food,&quot; Pollan says.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is not just what you eat but how you eat. &quot;Always leave the table a little hungry,&quot; Pollan says. &quot;Many cultures have rules that you stop eating before you are full. In Japan, they say eat until you are four-fifths full. Islamic culture has a similar rule, and in German culture they say, 'Tie off the sack before it's full.'&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Families traditionally ate together, around a table and not a TV, at regular meal times. It's a good tradition. Enjoy meals with the people you love. &quot;Remember when eating between meals felt wrong?&quot; Pollan asks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don't buy food where you buy your gasoline.

This choice is &lt;em&gt;absolutely great&lt;/em&gt; for animals and the environment!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a big difference between being vegan and being plant-pased, which I will try to simplify. Basically, being vegan doesn't necessarily mean that you're eating plant-based, and eating plant-based doesn't necessarily mean that you're vegan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Plant-based diets are about eating as healthily as possible - which is what leads us to eat whole plant foods exclusively, and exclude animal products and processed foods. However, people who follow a plant-based lifestyle may still wear fur or attend circuses - which vegans oppose due to animal exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Veganism is about causing as little suffering as possible - which is what leads us to eat foods that exclude animal products. Vegans may consume non-healthy vegan or &quot;accidentally vegan&quot; processed foods, though, such as Oreos. Oreos are not a whole food and would not be considered plant-based. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to protect animals and our planet, go vegan.

These are her words:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If two or more incomplete proteins are eaten at the same meal, one may supply the amino acids lacking in another, and together they may make a valuable contribution to health. ... Dr. Cannon&lt;a href=&quot;https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/6342&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;²&lt;/a&gt; has shown, however, that if half the essential amino acids are eaten at a certain time and the other half taken only one hour later, the body does not build protein with them. (p.29)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Davis is referencing a 1950 study by Paul R. Cannon titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/6342&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Recent Advances In Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. Cannon originated the idea that all amino acids must be eaten together in the same meal, but there are some concerns with the study. The rats were fed two alternating rations in which five essential amino acids had been totally removed, but this does not reflect any real food consumed by humans. A later publication by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44724443_Protein_turnover_in_mammalian_tissues_and_in_the_whole_body_JC_Waterlow_PJ_Garlick_and_DJ_Millward&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Waterlow et al.&lt;/a&gt; in 1978 showed that free phenylalanine in the human body corresponds to only about 1.5 hours worth of protein synthesis, so the poor growth of rat subjects is explained by phenylalanine deficiency when partial rations were separated by 2 hours or more. All plant proteins provide phenylalanine in abundance, so Cannon's study cannot be considered reflective of humans eating a realistic diet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if protein combining within meals isn't necessary, how much leeway do we have? Because some plant foods provide less lysine, free storage of lysine is an important consideration. It turns out that the body stores about 20 times more lysine than phenylalanine (based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12#597&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;protein free ratio&lt;/a&gt;) so we have a window of roughly one day (24 hours) in which to meet our lysine requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The &quot;incomplete&quot; protein&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's worth considering what protein &quot;completeness&quot; really means, because the notion of protein combining only makes sense if some proteins are indeed inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All essential amino acids are available in plant proteins, although the levels vary between foods. Classifying some proteins as incomplete gives the false impression that certain amino acids are absent, when in fact they are still present in similar quantities. Incomplete proteins are commonly said to &quot;lack&quot; a specific amino acid, which is often incorrectly interpreted as meaning the amino acid is missing. The degree to which we have internalized this misconception is shown in &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/a/177/1236&quot;&gt;Tom Kelly's answer&lt;/a&gt; to this question where he incorrectly writes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Incomplete protein sources aren't a bad thing. You just can't live entirely on only one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The falsity of that statement can be shown with a counterexample. Consider lentils, for example. Even though lentils are labelled as &quot;incomplete&quot; it is still quite possible to meet requirements for all essential amino acids by &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/a/1404/1236&quot;&gt;eating only lentils&lt;/a&gt;, with plenty of space left in the diet to add other foods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point is that protein completeness exists on a spectrum, and our intuitive understanding would be improved if we instead used the words &quot;complete&quot; and &quot;mostly complete&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Increasing muscle or losing fat&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People who are trying to lean out their body composition, either by increasing muscle or losing fat, may benefit by consuming a more optimal balance of amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When aiming for &lt;strong&gt;weight loss&lt;/strong&gt; the goal is to restrict energy intake (eat fewer calories) but still maintain intake of protein sufficient for normal body processes. Because most vegan sources of protein (especially whole food sources) come with additional energy in the form of carbohydrates, an imbalance of amino acids is associated with extra energy intake. This presents an opportunity to reduce energy intake by optimizing amino acid balance -- in other words, protein combining. The goal is to minimize calories while maximizing limiting amino acids. This particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;minimax&lt;/a&gt; scenario was the subject of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018836&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;2011 study&lt;/a&gt; by Peter J. Woolf et al. in which they developed a web-based optimizion tool called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vprotein.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;vProtein&lt;/a&gt; and discovered several unconventional protein pairings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Overall, the most efficient pairings include sweet corn/tomatoes, apple/coconut, and sweet corn/cherry. The top pairings also highlight the utility of less common protein sources such as the seaweeds laver and spirulina, pumpkin leaves, and lambsquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, people aiming to &lt;strong&gt;build muscle&lt;/strong&gt; (bodybuilders especially) will want to maximize the availability of all amino acids consumed. Because some very muscular people may be limited by the amount of food they can eat, optimizing amino acid balance allows for maximum &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myogenesis&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;myogenesis&lt;/a&gt;, or &quot;big gains&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Highly processed diets and the role of protein foods&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A diet that is full of refined carbohydrates and oils is going to be correspondingly lower in protein. This is what gives rise to the importance of &quot;protein foods&quot;. Proponents of a whole food plant based diet correctly point out that protein is abundant in vegetables, and a whole food diet draws on many sources of amino acids. However a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theminimalistvegan.com/junk-food-vegan/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;junk food vegan&lt;/a&gt; will be eating fewer whole foods and have fewer sources of protein, necessitating inclusion of more meat substitutes like tofu, protein powder, seitain, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Practical advice for vegetarians and vegans&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because our bodies have a limited short-term reserve of certain amino acids (up to a day's worth) and because all essential amino acids are included in all plant proteins, it's actually quite simple to meet protein and amino acid requirements on a vegan diet. As mentioned earlier, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/questions/283/which-essential-amino-acids-are-the-most-likely-to-be-deficient-in-a-vegan-diet/284#284&quot;&gt;lysine&lt;/a&gt; is most likely to be deficient on a vegan diet, so ensuring sufficient intake of lysine during the day pretty much covers all the bases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can see the result of this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/canada-food-guide/food-guide-basics/much-food-you-need-every-day.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Canada's Food Guide&lt;/a&gt; which recommends 3 servings of meat alternatives (legumes and soy products) per day.

When analyzing water footprint, &quot;green water&quot; refers to rainfall and other replenishable sources, whereas &quot;blue water&quot; refers to groundwater and aquifers that are drawn down and may not be replenished within our lifetime. When water is scarce, it may be difficult to produce sufficient food for humans if most of the food potential is wasted by feeding it to animals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Land&lt;/strong&gt; is a limited resource that can be allocated in various ways. Currently livestock (or livestock feed) occupy 1/3 of the Earth's ice-free land. If demand for meat continues to grow, then more land will need to be allocated to livestock. Land can only be converted, not produced, and agricultural land often starts as forested area.

For example, the greenhouse gas emissions from animal agriculture are often compared to emissions from vehicles for personal transportation. Greenhouse gas emissions may be dominant in a country with a lot of cars, whereas animal agriculture emissions might be dominant in a region with very few cars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When considering a geographical context that is smaller than the whole planet, it's also important to consider the impact of borders and trade.

The traditional view of environmentalism is closely linked with animal conservation. A conservationist wants to protect animal wildlife in order to preserve that wildlife for the use and enjoyment of future generations. A conservationist perspective includes animals as part of the environment to be protected and managed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, an animal rights perspective does not include wildlife as part of the inanimate environment. An animal rights perspective recognizes the sentience of animals and how they can benefit from a well-managed environment, just as humans can. An animal rights perspective does not consider bears, elephants, or fish as resources to be managed, but as fellow inhabitants of the world in which we all live.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Related Tags&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/global-warming&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;global-warming&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;global-warming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/oceans&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;oceans&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;oceans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/wildlife&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;wildlife&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1236" LastEditorUserId="1236" LastEditDate="2018-05-13T21:47:24.503" LastActivityDate="2018-05-13T21:47:24.503" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

We want to eat a bit of fruit, but if we eat too much it will get harder to meet our protein requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's a good idea to eat 3 servings of legumes/beans each day, especially when aiming to get all protein from whole plant foods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;If avoiding processed proteins, avoid oil and sugar too&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's one more category I haven't mentioned yet that is particularly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Refined oils and sugars: 0% energy from protein (olive oil, candy, margarine)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the whole vegetable foods listed above, refined oils and sugars don't contribute any useful protein to the diet.

Turn the heat down and cook, stirring, for 10 more minutes. Cooking improves the taste of the soymilk.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Strain the mixture through muslin. When cool, squeeze as much soymilk out of the cloth as possible. The solid part retained in the cloth is okara.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="74" LastActivityDate="2018-05-13T19:28:43.313" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

So I'm asking about changing food supply, not how many people self-identify as vegan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 1&lt;/strong&gt; - Animal agriculture stops expanding and maintains current levels. The human population keeps growing, but all new food demand is met with plant-based options so meat consumption per capita slowly drops. Retiring farmers are replaced by young farmers and slaughtered animals are replaced by newly bred animals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 2&lt;/strong&gt; - Animal agriculture goes out of style and nobody wants the job. Livestock farms shut down as farmers retire. Farms continue to breed and slaughter animals, but there are fewer and fewer farms as time goes by.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 3&lt;/strong&gt; - We stop breeding any new animals on farms. Everybody agrees that it's time to end the practice of farming animals in a prudent way. Farmers continue raising the animals currently on their farms and send them to slaughter as before, but the animals alive right now are the last ones to be living on farms. Meat production declines rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What would the growth curve of veganism look like under these scenarios?

Many other foods we eat have a worse ratio, so we end up needing something to correct that and put it back in balance. Adding cricket flour to your diet will only allow you to asymptotically approach balance with diminishing returns. To actually balance our fat intake we need something with a lot more omega-3 fats, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/questions/658/how-does-cooking-affect-omega-3-oils-in-flax-chia-and-other-seeds&quot;&gt;chia&lt;/a&gt; or flax seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fibre&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Winner: plant-based)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cricket powder has 1 gram insoluble dietary fibre (mostly chitin) per 12 gram serving, or 8% fibre by mass.

I'll consider a few off-the-shelf loaves of bread from my favourite breadmaker, Silver Hills.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://silverhillsbakery.ca/our-products/organic-multigrain/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Organic Multigrain&lt;/a&gt; - oats, rye, barley &lt;em&gt;(plus millet &amp;amp; quinoa which don't count)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://silverhillsbakery.ca/our-products/the-big-16/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Big 16&lt;/a&gt; - oats, rye, barley, corn &lt;em&gt;(plus millet, khorasan &amp;amp; rice)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So for the purposes of this analysis, let's consider &lt;strong&gt;oats, rye, and barley&lt;/strong&gt; as being common ingredients in multigrain food products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Comparing grains&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the NCCDB, here's what is provided by 100 grams of flour made from several different kinds of whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;             total protein (g)  lysine (mg)  fibre (g)  starch (g)&#xA;wheat flour              13.21          359       10.7        57.8&#xA;oat flour                13.15          637       10.1        57.9&#xA;rye flour                10.88          212       11.8        50.6&#xA;barley flour             10.00          366       16.6        54.3&#xA;spelt flour              14.57          409       10.7        53.9&#xA;millet flour             10.75          144        3.5        69.9&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In all cases, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/q/283/1236&quot;&gt;lysine&lt;/a&gt; content is slightly low. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/a/1404/1236&quot;&gt;reference profile for a complete protein&lt;/a&gt; has 51 mg lysine/g protein but these grains range from 13-48 mg/g. Because all grains are low in lysine, the addition of more grains does not compensate that weakness or make grain into a complete protein.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a nutritional perspective, I would say that multigrain food items do not offer much benefit compared to foods made from a single grain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Multigrain vs. Whole Grain&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Multigrain products are not necessarily whole grain products. A multigrain product might be produced from multiple grains where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/multigrain/faq-20057867&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;bran, germ, and endosperm has been removed&lt;/a&gt;. This would, of course, reduce the nutritional content of the food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If possible, try to identify multigrain products that are also made from whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Ezekiel 4:9 bread&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The preparation of Ezekiel 4:9 bread is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+4%3A9-17&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;described in the bible&lt;/a&gt; and may be one of the oldest multigrain formations still consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the example multigrain bread given above (wheat and barley), but the beans and lentils are the real feature here. Beans and lentils are both high in lysine, and help make the bread into a complete protein by balancing the amino acid profile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Further considerations&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some breads may be fortified or enriched with a variety of vitamins or minerals&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some breads may include seeds which substantially changes the nutritional content&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some breads are made from sprouted grains which are likely to have a different nutritional profile as a result of chemical changes within the grain&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Multigrain bread is not necessarily better than whole wheat bread, and in some cases may actually have lower protein and lysine content due to the inclusion of rye or millet. Overall, most grains are quite similar and combining grains does more to affect taste than nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a more balanced food, look for bread that includes non-grain ingredients such as seeds (especially flax) and legumes (beans or lentils).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1236" LastActivityDate="2018-05-15T00:15:53.870" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

In the history of mankind, the ability to sustain something as big as &lt;em&gt;a culture&lt;/em&gt; by purely plant-based means would not be &lt;em&gt;the easiest&lt;/em&gt; way of doing things and &lt;strong&gt;unless there exist strong outside pressures&lt;/strong&gt; (such as ethical ones that can be seen nowadays) then plant-based diet would be overshadowed by more diversified sources of nutrients. From the very beginning, human species sustained on a combination of animal (hunters) and plant (gatherers) food. Generally, for a change to happen, there needs to be a reason for the change. As it happens, there just never was a sufficiently big one for cultures to do differently. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also good to note that &lt;strong&gt;plant-based diet has some specific requirements such as cobalamin&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;B12&lt;/strong&gt;) which are hard/nearly impossible to get from plant-based diet alone and need to be supplemented. While this fact would be unknown to the civilizations that we are talking about, the simple correlations would probably be apparent over time, where people eating only plant-based diet would suffer from B12 defficiency symptoms (fatigue, depression, reduced mental capabilities, even psychosis).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only real source of outside pressure for most of our history as species would be probably &lt;strong&gt;religion&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;supreme ruler with plant-based agenda&lt;/strong&gt; in mind.

I will try to keep updating it as I learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;General theory&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beans, legumes, grains, nuts and, uh, seeds are all the seeds of the plant they come from. They have presumably evolved to store nutrients in durable forms and resist fully breaking down in the digestive systems of creatures that might swallow them so they may reach suitable soil and germinate. These foods thus have surfaces that physically and/or chemically resist digestion and protect the contents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My impression is that the full picture is somewhat more complex, and not widely understood. The majority of available information on the topic is poorly referenced, sometimes contradictory, and not always evidence-based. Some writers argue that we should not be eating these foods at all, others recommend soaking, sprouting and other techniques, and others write that such measures are unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While some of the substances in these foods that may be affected (or not) by soaking them aren't useful, others may have nutritional benefits. I would advise readers to consider their particular dietary requirements and keep an open mind and an eye out for credible research about this area of food and nutrition science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Beans&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The web is full of articles urging us to soak beans or not to soak beans. Finding any actual data on this topic is hampered by the noise of contradictory anecdotes and vague statements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering the few scraps of evidence derived from scientific approaches (here I broadly mean actually measuring things and controlling conditions) I was able to find, it seems that soaking beans has the same benefit as boiling them, in terms of reducing levels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligosaccharide&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;oligosaccarides&lt;/a&gt; such as raffinose and stachyose that cause flatulence due to their fermentation by bacteria in the large intestine. Soaking and boiling may reduce the levels of these chemicals more than boiling alone. It should be noted that oligosaccarides are prebiotics, meaning they are used by beneficial gut bacteria, the importance to health and complexity of which is, I think, only beginning to be understood...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some beans also contain toxic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;lectins&lt;/a&gt;. Not all lectins are harmful (and even the toxic ones have various scientific and medical uses), but red kidney and cannelini beans, for example, contain a lectin (soy beans contain another) that causes severe food poisoning if the beans are not cooked. Lectins can also act as &amp;quot;antinutrients&amp;quot;, binding nutrient chemicals so that they cannot be absorbed. Soaking at high temperature may reduce levels of lectins, but they need to be strongly heated to be fully destroyed (they are proteins, and so they denature at high temperature) and long soaking and low temperature cooking may increase toxicity.

Unfortunately, it does not attempt to determine whether the benefits of soaking could be achieved by a cooking process, such as cooking for longer, cooking at higher pressure or temperature and so on. Note that the soaking temperature used was high; 77 degrees C at the start, then 24 degrees C.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jf00062a028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; found that soaking reduced the levels of gas-producing oligosaccarides in 5 types of beans (including Bengal gram/kala chana which is a type of chickpea). Soaking with a very small quantity of bicarbonate of soda reduced levels significantly further (this can cause the skins of beans to break down further than they otherwise would. I make mushy peas by soaking dried green peas with bicarbonate of soda before cooking). Germination (sprouting) for 24 hours reduced levels further. After a 48 hour germination period, the oligosaccarides were undetectable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While anecdotal evidence says everything possible, I've read a few articles stating that soaking beans for longer than usual, say 24 hours, resulted in the eater suffering less digestive symptoms such as flatulence than short soaking, and my own experience and my family's bears this out. The temperature seems influential; beans definitely sprout faster if the temperature is higher, and whatever activities start to break down the surface chemicals seem to proceed faster in warmth. When the indoor temperature is less than 20 Celsius, I aim to soak beans for ~20 hours. When the indoor temperature is around 23-25 Celsius, 8 hours seems to do the trick. If it's warmer than that, I soak beans in the fridge (for up to 48 hours), as they start fermenting after about 12 hours otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beans also contain fairly high levels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytic_acid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;phytic acid&lt;/a&gt;, which binds zinc, iron and calcium so that they cannot be absorbed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livestrong.com/article/553811-how-to-eliminate-the-phytic-acid-in-beans/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; which refers to some studies on the topic, states that soaking decreases phytic acid content in beans. However, unlike the oligosaccarides that break down inside the beans during soaking and cooking, losing their discomfort-causing properties, phytic acid for the most part merely leaches into the water, and the soaking water must be discarded to obtain reduced levels in the food. Soaking in an acidified solution (add a few drops of lemon juice) is more effective than plain water. For most uses, I prefer to cook beans in the soaking water, because I think they taste better, but if you are concerned about reducing phytates, it may be better to discard. Sprouting beans (and lentils) causes the phytic acid (which, among other uses, is a phosphate store for the seed) to break down due to enzyme activity, and of course, sprouting involves rinsing off the soaking water. Note that phytates are thought by some to be nutritionally beneficial (and apparently have anti-cancer properties) and may not cause any adverse symptoms besides reduced mineral absorption (which may be a big problem for some people).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to note that soaking reduces the cooking time of beans (this is an environmental consideration: less energy is required to cook them, and if there were no other benefit of soaking, I personally would recommend it on that basis).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Sprouting beans&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some beans (and lentils, and seeds like mustard and alfalfa) (whole mung and moth beans are excellent for this, and chickpeas also do well) can be soaked, rinsed, and left to sprout (they need to be rinsed regularly to hydrate and remove any potentially harmful microorganisms) for 12-48 hours depending on the ambient temperature. These beans can be eaten raw (though this may be recommended only for immunocompetent people) or cooked. As mentioned earlier, studies show that germination effectively destroys gas-producing chemicals and phytic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Lentils&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like beans, lentils contain phytic acid. This can be removed by soaking and draining the soaking water, but lentils are usually not soaked or soaked only briefly (and probably for culinary purposes, as I think is the case with rice).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lentils also contain &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistant_starch&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;resistant starch&lt;/a&gt; which cannot be broken down into glucose by the human body, and is instead fermented by bacteria in the large intestine like those oligosaccarides we met earlier. This produces fatty acids which are absorbed and metabolized, and... gases in the gut. Soaking does not destroy resistant starch. Rather, levels are reduced by other processes such as grinding, or cooking in excess water. However, resistant starch reduces the glycemic index/load of the food (this means it reduces the overall rise in blood glucose caused by eating it), suggesting that it may be beneficial in improving or reducing the risk of developing insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, so eliminating it may not be desirable (as with phytates and oligosaccarides).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I need to find more data for this section.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nuts and seeds generally have much higher levels of phytic acid (which binds to iron, calcium and zinc, preventing their absorption) than cereal grains and lentils, but since they are usually eaten in small quantities this is not necessarily a problem in a balanced diet. Where nuts and seeds are eaten in large quantities, reducing phytates may be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Phytic acid content of nuts and seeds can be reduced by roasting or toasting, but soaking in a slightly acidic solution (add a few drops of lemon) overnight followed by thorough rinsing and dehydration (otherwise the food will decay) is more effective. I really have to mention here that the difference in taste between soaked nuts and unsoaked nuts is noticeable. Soaked and dried nuts and seeds taste as good or better to me as toasted nuts. This suggests to me that the process makes some good tasting (and possibly nutritious) chemicals more available, but I need to find more evidence for this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The effort and energy required to dehydrate nuts and seeds after soaking is too much for me (they can be bought, but they are prohibitively expensive), so as a compromise I might either toast/roast them if they need to be stored for a few days or used dry, or just soak and rinse if they can be used wet (for example, in raw desserts or cashew cream).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Summary Table&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;Substance       toxic lectins    raffinose &amp;    phytic acid      resistant starch&lt;/b&gt;&#xA;                                 &lt;b&gt;stachyose&lt;/b&gt;  &#xA;&#xA;&lt;b&gt;Why remove?&lt;/b&gt;     food poisoning   cause gas      binds Zn/Fe/Ca   causes gas&#xA;&#xA;&lt;b&gt;Sources&lt;/b&gt;         some beans       beans          beans,           lentils   &#xA;                                                grains,&#xA;                                                lentils,&#xA;                                                nuts &amp; seeds&#xA;&#xA;&lt;b&gt;Removed by&lt;/b&gt;      no               reduced        reduced          no&#xA;&lt;b&gt;soaking?&lt;/b&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;b&gt;Drain soak&lt;/b&gt;      -                no             yes              ?&#xA;&lt;b&gt;water?&lt;/b&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;b&gt;Better soak&lt;/b&gt;     -                baking soda    acid             -&#xA;&#xA;&lt;b&gt;Alternative&lt;/b&gt;     high heat        soak+sprout    soak+sprout      grind/boil&#xA;&lt;b&gt;removal&lt;/b&gt;                          fermentation   fermentation&#xA;&#xA;&lt;b&gt;Why not&lt;/b&gt;         -                lower GI       possible         lowers GI&#xA;&lt;b&gt;remove?&lt;/b&gt;                          prebiotic      benefits         prebiotic&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Note that baking soda is alkaline so you cannot simultaneously soak in an acidified solution and a baking soda solution (you could use excess acid, but the soda would be destroyed, having formed a sodium salt with whatever anion the acid provided).

I made a lemon cheesecake this weekend with a filling consisting of these ingredients blended until smooth:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;100g cashews soaked overnight and rinsed well&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;100g silken tofu&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;juice and zest of 2 lemons&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;50 ml maple syrup&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;3 tbsp rice syrup&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2 tbsp coconut oil&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup coconut flour&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The texture was wonderful. Coconut flour is rich and gives density without graininess. Also, of course, it doesn't rely on a temperature change to do its work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, cooked banana works as an amazingly effective setting ingredient. Fry the banana until very mushy, then mix with creamy, sweet and tasty ingredients like silken tofu, sugar and cocoa powder, refrigerate, and you get a thick mousse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My biggest success was a baked vanilla cheesecake based on a recipe from Yoshiko Takeuchi's book &lt;em&gt;Cooking with Soy&lt;/em&gt;. If you want something similar to a traditional baked cheesecake I recommend this method. I can't believe how good it is considering it's mostly tofu!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Baked vanilla cheesecake&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Base:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;80g cashews&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;80g oats&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 very heaped tbsp rice syrup&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 tbsp oil (preferably from the cashew butter jar - otherwise use peanut, safflower or canola oil)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Filling:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;~300g firm tofu, water drained off elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;~75ml maple syrup&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;zest of 1 lemon (optional)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;juice of half a lemon&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 tbsp kuzu*&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1-2 tsp vanilla seeds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2 tbsp coconut oil, melted if the weather is cold&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Put oats and cashews in a blender and grind.

If my assumption is wrong, this may not be the answer you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems almost unavoidable to find people with attitudes like that. However, there is a clear line between having a discussion (note, discussion is not a fight, but the exchange of arguments to find productive solutions and get closer to truth) and simply being mean. If what they do is to repeat hackneyed arguments, as you say, then to me it would signify that their purpose is closer to imposition and farther to discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My suggestion is that when people do not want to listen (at least in this specific issue, they may be open to work along in other subjects) your energy is better spend educating yourself, challenging your own assumptions and making better arguments, not arguing back. Do it for you and for the people that do want to listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As someone here pointed out, if you already asked clearly to stop pressing the issue and they didn’t, then it’s harassment. If they don’t stop is because they don’t want it to stop. &lt;strong&gt;Asking differently may not be the solution.&lt;/strong&gt; Running away from the problem only incentivize their behavior, something I don't think any vegetarian/vegan would like. If you don’t want to challenge them legally or aggresively and it keeps happening, then you have to get clever. You could mock about the irrationally of their arguments and how idiotic some of them may be, but this may escalate to aggression if done wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I’ve found (by experience) is that ignoring them altogether often gives them the courage to press further, until you break. What is the best answer for deaf ears then? Silence. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not a sad/angry silence, just silence. &#xA;Not a look away/change the subject silence, but a ‘look directly and firmly into their eyes’ silence.&#xA;Active silence, confident silence.&#xA;Not a single word until the subject changes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People is not used to this kind of reaction, nor to be looked in the eyes with impassive persistence.

Here's what I can contribute to this discussion. Unless you know for certain that coral rock was collected sustainably, i.e. already dead and collected on shore, don't buy, use, or exploit any product containing coral. Living coral is under tremendous environmental pressures caused by human activity, from pollution, global warming (the seas are profoundly affected, by rising temperatures and bleaching), commercial fishing, ocean bottom mining, and recreational indifference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many types of coral, so appearance is not necessarily indicative of where it came from or how it was collected. Coral, as has been mentioned, can refer to the animal living in the exoskeletons they create, or the skeletal remains of their homes. Many reefs are made up of a combination of living and dead coral. Living coral often builds on the remains of old dead coral skeletons, which is why it should not be collected from the sea, where it forms the base of reefs and provides homes for many aquatic critters and plants. So, dead coral has a purpose. Even coral that's washed up into shores will eventually be crushed by the forces of the ocean into sand, though modest collection of washed up coral rock doesn't seem problematical in the scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some places, such as South Florida, there are deposits of ancient seabeds well inland that are quarried for coral rock to be used for building and for other purposes. That coral provides no benefit to living aquatic organisms, and in my opinion is not much different than any other quarried rock. Nothing lives on or in it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if a product contains crushed quarried coral rock, I don't see any logical objection to its use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1785" LastEditorUserId="1929" LastEditDate="2023-03-08T20:49:32.510" LastActivityDate="2023-03-08T20:49:32.510" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I continued eating beef nonetheless. I started preparing my own burgers with ground beef -- and I enjoyed it. But veganism was still roaming around in the back of my head.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided to try a plant-based meal, a curry consisting of tofu and vegetables, the night after eating a home-made beef burger. It was markedly obvious that I did not experience the chronic lethargy that was the natural outcome after having eaten meat. I realised that I derived energy without feeling tired or struggling to digest my food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The night after I had another beef burger. My &lt;strong&gt;last&lt;/strong&gt; animal product. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I realised immediately is that eating meat, compared to eating plants, drained my intellectual energy -- I could feel a slow descent from wakefulness to inertia. I find this sensation contemptable, and it is precisely this sensation that is antithetical to my ideals and the practice of celibacy &lt;em&gt;because the descent of energy would counteract my intent to raise the energy (focus) into my mental faculties.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: this practice is not religiously motivated, but may entail &lt;em&gt;spirituality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This descent of energy, I observed, increased the likelihood of nocturnal ejaculation (wet dream), which compromises the practice of cultivating energy, whereas plant-based meals did not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, it was this experience of chronic fatigue and intellectual inertia that repulsed me and repelled me from eating animal products again. I went vegan overnight and realised the intellectual and moral consistency of this practice later with further inquiry -- especially when I was brave enough to watch footage of the animal holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After assimilating the implications of eating meat compared to plants, it was imperative that I make the transformation -- especially if I am genuinely concerned about and value my developmental and intellectual welfare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which I do. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And so I did. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I would have done it earlier if I ever had a plant-based meal to make the distinction that I needed to make.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="704" LastActivityDate="2018-09-12T20:57:18.703" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Note that this was long before the time statins were invented. Two populations living in Uganda were compared, the indigenous Africans had a low cholesterol while the Asians had a high cholesterol.

The Africans kept the calories from fat below 20%, while the Asians were getting about 40% of their calories from fat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the subsequent decades such studies were difficult to replicate, as hardly no one eats like the indigenous Africans were eating. The few populations left who still do eat this way live in remote areas where there are no hospitals, therefore there are no hospital records that can be used to do research on heart attack and stroke risks of these populations. This lack of data allowed the mistaken idea to prevail that cardiovascular disease is a normal part of the aging process. According to this idea, we can lower the risk to a limited degree by adopting a healthy lifestyle, e.g. by sticking to the Mediterranean diet, but we can forget about drastically reducing the risk to close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That this idea is wrong was recently shown by scientists who found a way to test indigenous populations for cardiovascular risk factors.

To illustrate how, let's consider two other examples. Krill-eating whales play an important role in the nutrient cycle of the ocean, and their fecal plumes directly contribute to the growth of phytoplankton. Many species of rainforest trees spread through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_dispersal#Animals&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;zoochory&lt;/a&gt;, the process of seeds being consumed and later released by animals. What do these examples have in common? Both examples require the participation of non-human animals, and these two examples are responsible for much of the oxygen available on Earth. In this way, the oxygen we breathe is 'made' by animals in much the same way that fruit is 'made' by bees. Pollination is a byproduct for bees; it's not like they were planning to come back later to harvest the almonds and avocados. Honeybees (and other bees) gain their benefit immediately from interaction with the plant, not from the plant that results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, it is unreasonable to label something as non-vegan because animals were involved or participated at some point. Veganism is not a rejection of the natural environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;When Participation Becomes Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The modern horror of animal agriculture started to take hold in the 1960's and later, but long-distance migratory beekeeping actually started much earlier, around 1920's. For a closer look at migratory beekeeping, take a look at the modern practice of migratory beekeeping &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/migratory-beekeeping-mind-boggling-math/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this 2013 article&lt;/a&gt; from Scientific American. Here's an excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In all, more than 31 billion honeybees converge on California’s Central Valley each February to pollinate the almond trees. [...] California's almond orchards are the most important stop on a massive annual migration of around 1,600 of the nation's beekeepers and their colonies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this isn't just limited to California or almonds. The exact same approach with honeybees is copied in Canada, the world's second-largest producer of blueberries. But this abnormal manipulation of bees lives is harmful, and is driving a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestar.com/vancouver/2018/04/28/bc-beekeepers-worry-blueberries-are-making-their-bees-sick.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;growing rift&lt;/a&gt; between agriculturalists and beekeepers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Veganism is not only the practice of abstaining from animal products, but also a philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals and the exploitative relationship that humans have forced upon other species. So after learning about this, some vegans wonder if they expand their boycott and abstain from a larger category of foods in order to protest our current exploitative relationship with bees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;It's Not About You&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For vegans who are motivated by concerns about our relationship with animals, the practices of abstention (not consuming) and boycott (not purchasing) are intended to help grow social change which builds momentum toward a larger social change away from exploiting animals. The animal products which are most closely associated with veganism fall into very well-defined categories with understandable boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any consumption of animal meat depends on &lt;em&gt;slaughter&lt;/em&gt;; the exploited animal will definitely be dead. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any consumption of dairy or eggs requires humans to &lt;em&gt;manipulate the reproductive systems&lt;/em&gt; of cows, chickens, or other birds.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These categories have clear boundaries, and that makes them more effective for abstention and boycott. But in contrast, concerns about unfair relationships with honeybees does not have a clear boundary. Surely we can think of some other unfair relationships?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The expansion of palm oil plantations often comes at the cost of destroyed wildlife habitat. Isn't habitat destruction an unfair relationship?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aren't temporary foreign workers exploited as agricultural hands for low pay? Why should we worry about unfair labour relationships with bees if we are ignoring unfair labour relationships with humans?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most organic farms &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/q/1246/1236&quot;&gt;use animal manure&lt;/a&gt; as fertilizer. There's nothing wrong with cow dung itself (especially on grasslands) but the &lt;em&gt;collection&lt;/em&gt; and storage of dung strongly suggests animal confinement and exploitation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are countless examples like these. Truly, we would be hard pressed to think up any kind of food production that is truly cruelty-free, except for the food that we grow in our own gardens. This is what people are talking about when they say &quot;there is no ethical consumption under capitalism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we decided that avocados and almonds are not vegan because of how bees are exploited, then the only logical conclusion would be to label most other food as non-vegan as well. In this way the vegan label loses meaning and loses power for driving abstention and boycott.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is very much in the interests of some wealthy business people to weaken the vegan movement by making it appear inconsistent or impossible to follow. When you hear stories about avocados and almonds not being vegan, take a close look at who is saying that, and why. Do they have a history of advocating for bees and other animals? Or are they just trying to make vegans look bad?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What Can Be Done For Bees?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have established an uneasy truce with ourselves, we're ready to ask... what can be done to help change the way that humans exploit bees?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where I feel that ethical consumption has reached its limits, and if we really care about this issue then we need to direct our attention to &lt;em&gt;ethical production&lt;/em&gt;. If you are able to establish a garden and grow your own food, you'll be doing a great service to both yourself and any species of bees that live nearby. You can go a step farther and start learning about polycultures and permacultures, new agricultural systems that don't depend on the current practice of migratory beekeeping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Bonus Round&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We aren't really 100% dependent on bees for pollination.

According to the excerpt below, it appears that both meat eaters and vegetarians are equally deficient in B12.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Framingham Offspring study found that 39 percent of the general&#xA;  population may be in the low normal and deficient B12 blood level&#xA;  range, and it was not just vegetarians or older people. &lt;strong&gt;Most&#xA;  interestingly there was no difference between those ate meat, poultry,&#xA;  or fish and those who did not eat those foods.&lt;/strong&gt; The people with the&#xA;  highest B12 blood levels were those who were taking B12 supplements&#xA;  and eating B12 fortified cereals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, let's examine why modern meat no longer supplies an adequate amount of B12.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[B12] is made by bacteria that live in soil and in the guts of animals. Cattle and other grass-eating animals get B12 and B12 producing bacteria from clumps of dirt around the grass roots that they pull up. Chickens and other birds get B12 from pecking around for worms and other insects. These animals store B12 mostly in their livers and muscles and some B12 pass into milk and eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But, cattle no longer feed on grass and chickens do not peck in the dirt on factory farms. Even if they did, pesticides often kill B12 producing bacteria and insects in soil. Heavy antibiotic use kills B12 producing bacteria in the guts of farm animals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your question about frequency is difficult to precisely answer but the article does state:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In order to maintain meat a source of B12 the meat industry now adds it to animal feed, 90% of B12 supplements produced in the world are fed to livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for if the animals need the B12 to be healthy, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://eerainuh.com/supplementation-of-vitamin-b12-in-cattle-and-sheep-to-prevent-deficiency/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this article about sheep and cows&lt;/a&gt;, the answers seems to be yes. They need b12 for similar reasons as humans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 is essential for cell growth and maturation, energy&#xA;  production and wool growth. In general, sheep are more susceptible to&#xA;  Vitamin B12 deficiency than cattle are. Rapidly growing animals (i.e.&#xA;  lambs/calves and weaners) are most likely to develop a B12 deficiency&#xA;  and will suffer most badly when a deficiency develops. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Clinical signs of Vitamin B12 deficiency include weight loss,&#xA;  suppressed appetite, decreased feed efficiency, anaemia, diarrhoea,&#xA;  rough coat, scaly ears and weepy eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="53" LastEditorUserId="89" LastEditDate="2018-10-23T15:09:42.847" LastActivityDate="2018-10-23T15:09:42.847" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Eisnitz, 1997) shares many anecdotes quoted directly from workers on slaughterhouse kill lines. Here's a quote from Tommy Vladak, a sticker for nine years at Morrell slaughterhouse plant in Sioux City.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You're just putting in your time. And then it gets to a point where you're at a daydream stage. Where you can think about everything else and still do your job. You become emotionally dead. [...] And you get just as sadistic as the company itself. When I was sticking down there, I was a sadistic person.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The worst part,&amp;quot; he continued, &amp;quot;even worse than my accident, was what happened to my family life. I'd come home, my wife would ask me how my night went, and instead of being happy to see her I'd say, 'What the hell do you care?' We'd get into arguments about stupid things.&amp;quot; [...] &amp;quot;My wife and I finally separated in early July,&amp;quot; Vladak said, &amp;quot;about two weeks before I cut my face. She couldn't take the bitching any more. I'd blow up at the drop of a hat, come home every night and find something to complain about, and take my frustrations from work out on my family.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And here's a quote from Steve Jansson, another man who worked at the same slaughterhouse in Sioux city.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The worst thing, worse than the physical danger, is the emotional toll. If you work in that stick pit for any period of time, you develop an attitude that lets you kill things but doesn't let you care. You may look a hog in the eye that's walking around down in the blood pit with you and think, God, that really isn't a bad-looking animal. You may want to pet it. Pigs down on the kill floor have come up and nuzzled me like a puppy. Two minutes later I had to kill them -- beat them to death with a pipe. I can't care.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sometimes I looked at people that way, too,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I've had ideas of hanging my foreman upside down on the line and sticking him. I remember going into the office and telling the personnel man that I have no trouble pulling the trigger on a person--if you get in my face I'll blow you away. [...] Every sticker I know carries a gun, and every one of them would shoot you. Most stickers I know have been arrested for assault.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're not convinced by anecdotes, there are also studies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228141419_A_Slaughterhouse_Nightmare_Psychological_Harm_Suffered_by_Slaughterhouse_Employees_and_the_Possibility_of_Redress_through_Legal_Reform&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;A Slaughterhouse Nightmare: Psychological Harm Suffered by Slaughterhouse Employees and the Possibility of Redress through Legal Reform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This account invites a connection between the cruel nature of the slaughterhouse industry and the cruel actions of the slaughterhouse workers—having been instructed by their supervisors to rip off birds’ heads, the workers feel no remorse in tossing around dying birds “just for fun.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this country, we have a common understanding that taking pleasure in the cruel death of a helpless animal is an antisocial and potentially psychotic characteristic.&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;  The countless stories of slaughterhouse employees inflicting pain on animals “just for fun” indicate that the nature of the slaughterhouse work may have caused psychological damage to the employees, because the employees’ actions certainly rise to the level of abnormal cruelty that would cause concern among the general population.&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By studying the nature of psychological trauma, analyzing specific psychological mechanisms that would contribute to slaughterhouse workers’ trauma, and reviewing anecdotal evidence of slaughterhouse trauma, the remainder of this section will demonstrate that slaughterhouse workers likely suffer serious psychological trauma in their workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1236" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-18T08:37:18.697" LastActivityDate="2018-10-23T21:48:14.600" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If this is true,&#xA;  then  as long as crop  production  uses less than  half as many hectares  as&#xA;  ruminant-pasture to deliver the same amount of food, a vegetarian will kill&#xA;  fewer animals than an omnivore.  In fact,  crop production  uses less than&#xA;  half as many hectares as grass-fed dairy and one-tenth as many hectares&#xA;  as grass-fed beef to deliver the same amount of protein. &lt;strong&gt;In one year, 1,000&#xA;  kilograms  of protein  can be produced  on as few as 1.0 hectares  planted&#xA;  with soy and corn, 2.6 hectares used as pasture for grass-fed dairy cows,&#xA;  or 10 hectares used as pasture for grass-fed beef cattle (Vandehaar, 1998;&#xA;  UNFAO, 1996).&lt;/strong&gt; As such, to obtain the 20 kilograms of protein per year&#xA;  recommended for adults, a vegan-vegetarian would kill 0.3 wild animals&#xA;  annually, a lacto-vegetarian would kill 0.39 wild animals, while a Davis-&#xA;  style omnivore would kill 1.5 wild animals.

Good sources are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;legumes, nuts and seeds especially hemp and chia, soy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (pick fermented products where it’s possible), &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;peas and plant-based protein powders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Fibre, which is naturally contained in plant foods, helps to balance blood sugar by slowing the time it takes for carbohydrates to be digested, therefore slowing the release of glucose into the blood stream. Many soluble fibres can also be fermented by intestinal bacteria and improve insulin sensitivity. Examples are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;flaxseeds, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, collard greens, broccoli, squash, turnips, rutabagas, parsnips, chicory and beets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Other good sources of fibre are whole grains like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;quinoa, brown rice and oats&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important point:&lt;/strong&gt; Apart from these foods, it is important to indulge in some kind of &lt;strong&gt;exercise daily as physical activity increases insulin sensitivity&lt;/strong&gt;. This simply means that exercising regularly helps your body to use up the available sugar in your blood stream and move it to the tissues and muscles where it can be properly utilized and stored.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy enough sleeping time. The recommend 7-8 hours are not only good for fighting fatigue and mood swings but for improving hormonal regulation, and therefore blood sugar as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thebloodsugardiet.com/recipes-by-meal-type/vegetarian/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;103 vegetarian recipes&lt;/a&gt; (Blood sugar diet)&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This answer cites&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupali-datta-05415910/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dr. Rupali Datta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Consultant,Dietetics and Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandra-felice-699a6019/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Alessandra Felice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Registered Nutritional Therapist, Medicinal and Plant based Chef, Trainer and Consultant, Nutritional Content Writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/maggiepowers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Maggie Powers&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, &lt;em&gt;president-elect 2016 of Health Care &amp;amp; Education at the American Diabetes Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1918" LastEditorUserId="74" LastEditDate="2018-11-01T08:27:19.193" LastActivityDate="2018-11-01T08:27:19.193" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

A distinction can be made between two groups of fats: &lt;strong&gt;saturated fats&lt;/strong&gt; which are usually solid at room temperature, and &lt;strong&gt;unsaturated fats&lt;/strong&gt;, which are usually liquid at room temperature. Fatty acids are made up of chains of carbon atoms with a COOH (carboxyl group) at one end. A fatty acid with no double carbon-carbon bonds (C=C) it's considered to be a saturated fatty acid. Fatty acids with C=C bonds are unsaturated fatty acids. Fatty acids with one double bond are monounsaturated; those with more than one double bond are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fatty_acid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;polyunsaturated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HKsaJ.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HKsaJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;fatty acid chains&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Saturated fat&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although saturated fatty acids are not necessarily bad, they tend to increase levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood, which can form deposits on artery walls, leading to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat#Association_with_diseases&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;cardiovascular health problems&lt;/a&gt;. Saturated fats are mainly found in foods derived from animals such as meat, lard and milk products. However, they can also be found in vegetable oils such as palm oil and coconut oil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Unsaturated fat&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some unsaturated fatty acids are essential, meaning they are needed for biological processes and cannot be produced inside the body from other nutrients. Therefore we need to eat them. There are 3 groups of nutritionally important unsaturated fatty acids: Omega 3, Omega 6 and Omega 9 (the naming depends on where the double bonds are in the chain).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6eeJB.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6eeJB.png&quot; alt=&quot;omega 9, 6, 3 fatty acid chains&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omega 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fats include alpha-linolenic acid, which is found in some plant-based foods such as flaxseed, chia seeds and walnuts. 1 teaspoon of ground flaxseeds or 5 walnuts provide your daily source of Omega 3. ALA can be converted into the essential omega 3 fatty acids &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;DHA&lt;/a&gt;, which is found in fish oils, algae and breast milk, and EPA, which is found in fish oils.

You can take high doses on a less regular basis and doctors do prescribe injections of vitamin B12 for patients with severe deficiency. Most vegans aren’t severely deficient, they’re at a &lt;em&gt;high risk&lt;/em&gt; of deficiency without dietary supplements. Bioavailability and absorption are the main reasons for this recommendation. It’s better to take lower doses often as you won’t absorb as much of a higher dose (which is why these are injections).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the anthropology, it is more complex than that. Early hominins may have been on a largely plant-based diet but they weren’t strictly vegan, they were scavengers and hunters. They ate basically anything necessary to survive. It is difficult to generalise about early human diets due to the diversity between populations, even with more accurate genomic data recently. Plants were often their main source of carbohydrates and proteins but a small amount of other foods if enough for micronutrients. They occasionally also ate fish and eggs. They’re also known to have eaten bone marrow (tools have been found to extract it) of animals killed other predators even before hunting. These are also sources rich in vitamin B12. As mentioned by others, the source of B12 in animals is the bacteria that they eat. They were also exposed to more bacteria than we are now living in clean sanitised environments including our food and drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s also inaccurate to claim that early hominins were still “healthy”, despite being on a largely plant-based diet. By modern standards, they were not. Life expectancy is a poor indicator here since infant mortality and disease were high, so those surviving into adulthood still lived over the average life expectancy. They still did not live nearly as long as we do today. We cannot cite a plant-based diet as the only cause of this. There are many other differences to our environment and lifestyle. This was a time when an infection could fester and be life threatening. A broken bone or losing your teeth could be a death sentence. We simply cannot compare our health to this time period. These were by no means the best conditions to be healthy. Your doctors recommendations are based on medical and biochemical studies on what is best for your health and well-being, not how your ancestors managed to survive despite suffering many now preventable illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Improvements in nutrition have been shown to have caused our average height to increase meaningfully, even in the last few centuries. A better understanding of our needs for vitamins is a contributing factor for this (such as the reduction in scurvy and rickets). A deficiency in vitamins in childhood is much more of a concern than adulthood as it can affect your growth and development irreversibly. This continues to occur in the developing world and certainly did in early hominins. There are known time periods of population bottlenecks and low genetic diversity that are evidence that human populations came close to extinction several times (a few 100,000 years ago). Starvation in harsh conditions has been suggested to have caused this (and the may have lead to the migrations that followed).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="159" LastEditorUserId="74" LastEditDate="2018-11-15T17:45:52.003" LastActivityDate="2018-11-15T17:45:52.003" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

So you could then point out some vegetables and stress the delicious taste of those vegetables in return you could keep on doing this until you have eaten as much vegetarian/vegan food as you want. Then when you are full you don't have to make any excuses any more until the next meal when you'd do the same thing over again. Eventually everyone'd become used to referring to vegetarian/vegan food with you. You'd probably need to politely remind/prompt people that you are a vegetarian/vegan but you shouldn't find that too difficult to do if you truly love to eat only vegetarian/vegan food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need persistence and willpower to be disciplined enough to eat only vegetarian/vegan food and not to give in to other peoples' influence as long as you keep on insisting to everyone that you know what you prefer to eat and that you are healthy as a vegetarian/vegan you should be OK. Only you are responsible for what food you put into your mouth so you should believe in yourself and look only for food you would like to eat not food you wouldn't like to eat. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other people can't make you love meat/fish. You could always insist that you love vegetables/fruits more than anything else. A huge hamburger might look tasty. However a small apple might have an even greater burst of excitement in terms of flavour. Diets are not in competition with each other. You just need to be confident enough to tell everyone around you that you love your diet and you don't want to cheat it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1958" LastEditorUserId="1958" LastEditDate="2019-06-15T12:32:16.363" LastActivityDate="2019-06-15T12:32:16.363" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Any person considering adding iron supplements to their diet should have a conversation with their doctor or a registered dietitian to assess their individual needs and the safety of a particular supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The human body tries hard to maintain a stable level of iron in the blood and liver (homeostasis). When iron storage is depleted we may present with &lt;a href=&quot;https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/#h5&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;iron deficiency anemia&lt;/a&gt;. But if levels get too high, we may present with &lt;a href=&quot;https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/#h8&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;iron overload&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no physiologic regulatory mechanism for excreting iron. Once it has been absorbed into your body, it mostly stays there; only a small amount (1-2 mg/day) is removed through normal processes like menstrural blood loss, gastrointestinal blood loss and skin shedding. For this reason, it is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; important that the body regulates how much iron is absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most whole foods contain some trace amounts of iron, even the common potato. For example, if you were to eat a diet of nothing but potatoes (2000 kcal/day) that would provide about 40 mg of iron, which is far more than our bodies require. So our digestive system (specifically enterocytes in the duodenum) down-regulates how much iron is absorbed in order to prevent iron overload.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: About 1 in 250 people of white/caucasian descent have a family history of hemochromatosis which causes the body to improperly down-regulate absorption of iron, causing more rapid iron buildup and overload. People with hemochromatosis should definitely not be taking iron supplements, which is part of why it's important to discuss this with a doctor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's true that heme/haem iron is absorbed more readily than non-heme iron, but that is not necessarily a good thing for the reasons shown above. If increased iron absorption is desired, the best thing to do is consume foods providing vitamin C (ascorbic acid) along with foods rich in non-heme iron. One effective combination is &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/q/1475/1236&quot;&gt;spinach and lemon juice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, iron deficiency anemia can be masked by B12 anemia.

In this state, the body obtains much of its energy from metabolism of dietary fat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ketogenic diet (KD) was originally introduced in the 1920s as a therapeutic diet for adults with epilepsy, and that diet required a 4:1 ratio of fat (in grams) to protein plus carbohydrates (in grams). Because a gram of fat provides much more energy than a gram of carbohydrate or protein, the corresponding energy intake ratio would be 9:1 (90% energy from fat). Assuming energy intake of 2000 kcal/day, this diet would include 200 grams fat (1800 kcal), about 40 grams protein (160 kcal) and 10 grams total carbs (40 kcal).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not possible to satisfy protein requirements if total carbs are limited to 10 grams/day and only vegetarian foods are consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since most people aren't presenting with epilepsy and modern interest in the ketogenic diet is motivated by other factors, many people have embraced a more relaxed variant called the Modified Atkins Diet which allows up to 20 grams of &lt;em&gt;net carbs&lt;/em&gt; per day. (Dietary fibre is not included when counting net carbs). This is important when trying to include plant-based foods in a ketogenic diet because unlike meat, many plant foods are rich in dietary fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We'll call the diet &lt;em&gt;ketogenic&lt;/em&gt; if the daily net carb intake is less than 20 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Can I get enough energy on a vegetarian ketogenic diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It may be difficult to obtain sufficient energy on a diet which excludes meat and also limits net carb intake to 20 grams. To answer this question, let's devise a number we'll call the Keto Energy Score (KES) which is the ratio of kcal (energy) to net carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we need to consume at least 2000 kcal per day, while limiting net carbs to 20 grams per day, then our diet needs to have a KES of 100 or higher. (2000/20 = 100). Any foods that have a KES higher than 100 can be included without limitation. Foods with KES less than 100 need to be limited, otherwise net carbs will exceed 20 grams per day and the diet won't be ketogenic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To find the KES for any food, divide the energy (in kcal) by the net carbs (in grams). Let's consider some examples below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;KES higher than 100&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These foods all definitely fit into a ketogenic diet because their KES is greater than 100, so eat as much as you want. These form the basis of a vegetarian ketogenic diet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;flax seed (&gt; 100)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;hemp heart (&gt; 100)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;vegetable oil (&gt; 100)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;margarine (&gt; 100)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;butter (&gt; 100)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;whole chicken egg (&gt; 100)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cheddar cheese (&gt; 100)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;KES 50-100&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These foods can be included sparingly on a ketogenic diet, but they do not form the basis of the diet. Everything in this category must be balanced by also eating something from the first category.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;coconut (85)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;avocado (85)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;almond (60)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;egg white (73)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;chia seed (63)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;KES &amp;lt; 50&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These foods have a very low KES (Keto Energy Score) because they have a higher quantity of carbohydrates. These must be almost entirely avoided on a ketogenic diet because even a few dozen grams will push daily net carbs over the 20 gram limit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;tofu (40)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;nutritional yeast (45)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;peanut butter (36)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;whole cow's milk (12)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;broccoli (9)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;sweet bell pepper (8)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;blueberries (5)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;potato (5)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Is it healthy for a lacto-ovo vegetarian to follow Ketogenic diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the results above, it's pretty clear that cheese, and eggs would be very important components of a lacto-ovo vegetarian ketogenic diet because they become the main source of protein. Without these, the diet would be composed of mostly refined oils. &lt;em&gt;(So it would be all but impossible to be healthy on a vegan ketogenic diet that excluded cheese and eggs.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But even allowing for a pound of cheese and a dozen eggs every day, it would still be very challenging to stay healthy on this diet. Vitamins B1, B3, and B12 would all be in short supply. It would also be difficult to meet requirements for trace minerals copper, iodine, magnesium, manganese, and potassium. There isn't much space in the diet to include other foods, so a multi-vitamin and other supplements would quite likely be necessary to meet recommended daily intake for all nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It also seems impossible to get anywhere close to the recommended daily intake for dietary fibre (30 grams/day) while following any ketogenic diet, but that isn't unique to vegetarians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR No, it is not healthy for a vegetarian to follow a ketogenic diet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;But what about...&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you saw or heard about somebody who said they were doing vegan keto.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thomas DeLauer on YouTube posted this apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/eVzLr4tCJxo?t=250&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;vegan+keto chili&quot; recipe&lt;/a&gt; but if you break it down, it has 29 grams of net carbs (52 grams total carbs!) and only 400 kcal which isn't even &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; to keto (KES=14). &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/eVzLr4tCJxo?t=477&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Later&lt;/a&gt; he suggests relying on flax, chia, coconut, coconut yogurt, high quality low-soy vegan cheese, artichoke, asparagus, nutritional yeast. Of those, &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; flax seeds (KES&gt;100) properly count as keto. To provide 2000 kcal on those other foods would include somewhere between 32 and 362 grams of net carbs (86 - 450 g total carbs) depending on the actual mix. He says in the video it was only barely possible by eating a lot of protein powder every day. The fact that he measured ketone bodies in his bloodstream was more suggestive of actual starvation than simulated starvation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Danielle Belardo, MD (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheVeggieMD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;@TheVeggieMD&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter) recently experimented with doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheVeggieMD/status/1158883507005022208&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;vegan keto for two weeks&lt;/a&gt;.

This doesn't meet the modern definition of a ketogenic diet (&amp;lt;20 grams net carbs per day) but was still apparently enough to put her body into ketosis (though &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheVeggieMD/status/1151837238642302977&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;her test of 1.5 mmol/L&lt;/a&gt; is arguably only borderline ketosis).

Suppose somebody who readily buys meat at the grocery store, had they happened upon the dead deer, would have picked up the deer and prepared and eaten it. However, you got to it before they did. In that case, the meat-buyer would likely buy more meat than they would have, had they taken the deer. Thus, you indirectly caused more meat to be bought in the grocery store.

In those regions, the people who could drink milk had a relatively dependable and nutritious food source that others didn't at a time when food shortages were common.

Right now, I am trying again but even though my friends and family are used to me being vegetarian, it is still tough being vegan.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I notice very different reactions to vegetarians and vegans.  40 years ago, it was hard to be vegetarian anywhere except India.  In those days, you ate what your mother served (or occasionally your father).  I could not become either vegetarian or vegan until I left home.  The primary reaction from those around me was that I was weird or a nuisance but I have rarely encountered hostility as a vegetarian.  Over the years, in many countries (e.g. here in the UK) vegetarianism has become more common and it is much easier now.  I have moved from being very weird to just a little weird.  However, at the same time, I feel that acceptance of veganism is much lower and may even be decreasing.   I encounter a lost of hostility to veganism.  I am often shocked at how bad it is.  Just the other day, my wife and I visited a friend of hers.  I had met the friend's husband only briefly before and I was quite unprepared for his assault on veganism.  He was clearly trying to pick a fight and I had to make a very considerable effort to avoid an unpleasant scene.  His wife works in a steakhouse and mentioned that her manager was a vegan.  Certainly, this is odd but he got even more agitated by this news and started on about the hypocrisy.  In 40 years, I have not experienced a reaction this bad as a vegetarian.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on where you live, it might now be easy to be vegetarian.  For example, here in the UK, pretty much every restaurant has some vegetarian option.  You may have little choice and it might not be good but it means that you can join your friends and family without limiting their choice of restaurant.  Far fewer restaurants have vegan options and the understanding is even lower.  I will face that challenge in a moment.  My meat eating wife wants to eat out.

Male chicks are also killed at birth because there is no use for them in the egg industry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can see the difference between the two definitions. In the operative one that excludes rennet but not milk, we won't eat the dead body or its substances. We will not eat the dead themselves. This is true even if the substances themselves have been removed leaving only traces (thinking of non-vegetarian wine). In the one you proposed that [ought to] exclude[s] milk, we won't eat the substances whose production entails other deaths. We will not eat the substances produced only at the cost of death.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The smallness of this difference, the realization that eating the dead one barely differs from eating that which causes death, is one of the paths towards the practice of veganism, but to exclude rennet we don't need to travel that far.

You are free to pick your own definition and there are many variations.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was first vegetarian many years ago, some people took it to mean just &quot;don't eat meat&quot; and expected that I would eat fish and even chicken since it was common then for &quot;meat&quot; to mean what is now usually termed &quot;red meat&quot;.  The understanding has gradually improved over the years though more recently, people who eat fish and seafood but not other meat are becoming common and I know several who also eat chicken but not other meat.  Some of these people call themselves &quot;vegetarian&quot; though usually when challenged they will admit &quot;well not really&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even ignoring these odd positions (*), there is a lot of variation in the interpretation of vegetarianism.  At the strict end, they will check that their cheese did not use rennet and their beer or wine did not use finings.  At the less strict end, they will just avoid things that are obviously bits of dead animals and will happily eat a dessert without worrying about whether it contained gelatine.  A position that I have seen a lot is being strict (e.g. avoiding rennet) except for alcoholic drinks.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(*) Not so much odd positions but just odd if called vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some of my less strict phases, I would eat cheese with rennet.  My defense was that it could have been made without but in a meat dominated economy there was no incentive for the manufacturers to avoid rennet.  I used to have to go to a specialist shop and have very little choice to get rennet free cheese. This has improved over the years probably because there are now enough rennet avoiding vegetarians to affect the market.  Rennet free cheese is now easy to obtain and there is plenty of choice.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people, even meat eaters, have limits as to what they will eat.  E.g. cannibals are extremely rare.  Fortunately, few people will eat other primates and I think that most would decline dolphin.  I think that the two extremes, eat anything edible and vegan, are the easiest to defend.  Any position in between is some sort of compromise.  When I was vegetarian but not vegan, I would defend my position and admit that it was a compromise but closer to the vegan end than most.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2035" LastActivityDate="2019-01-13T12:00:33.617" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Instead the honey taken has to be replaced with some other food source, that's usually sugar water which is a poor food source for bees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are some ways of catching the excess honey that drips out of the bottom of a hive and would otherwise end up on the floor, but that's not going to produce on a scale that makes it more than a fringe endeavour.  Again many ethical vegans will not object to people eating that otherwise wasted honey.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why not eats eggs and honey and wear wool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost I don't feel like I'm missing out on this stuff, I don't think about it day to day unless someone asks me a question about it.

This is sometimes called lacto-ovo vegetarian or more often just vegetarian.  If you see a product or menu item labelled &quot;vegetarian&quot; then it might contain milk or eggs.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eat no animal products, neither milk nor eggs.

Vegan items would be suitable but this is unnecessarily strict.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vegetarians commonly eat honey but vegans don't.

While this is inherently opinionated and varies from vegan to vegan, I'm trying to include as broad a variety of reasons as I can so that at least one should apply to a given vegan who refuses to make a particular exception. These reasons broadly include practicality (1-5), human cognitive biases (6-10), and ethics (8-11).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the lack of citations. I added parenthetical notes where I think they would be most useful if someone wants to edit them in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First we need to assume that there's a particular ethical precept that on the surface compels eventual veganism, and then we need to assume the existence of animal-derived products which are on the surface compatible with the ethical precept.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ethical precept I'm assuming is that &lt;strong&gt;humans should not increase nonhuman animal suffering for the sake of human pleasure/profit.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, it would be permissible to: kill an animal in self defense (animal suffers for human survival), forcibly vaccinate a dog against rabies (animal suffers to reduce their future suffering), and teach wild monkeys to bring difficult-to-harvest fruits to humans in exchange for relatively worthless trinkets (animal is exploited by humans without suffering). But it would not be permissible to: selectively breed sheep to produce excess wool at the expense of overall health, force a dog to stay inside for human convenience when the dog would rather run around outside, and to upset the monkeys that are being exploited at the end of the previous sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My other assumption is that &lt;strong&gt;animal-derived products have been acquired by humans in ways that don't increase animal suffering and are available for this ethical vegan.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, this might include meat from cows that died of old age after living full lives in appropriate environments. But it would not include &quot;free range&quot; eggs where the hens roam around for all of 2 years before being killed for not laying fast enough, or where (non-laying) male chicks are killed as soon as they're sexed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Answers&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With these assumptions, here's why an animal welfare vegan might still decline to consume/use animal-derived products that came into human possession without causing animal suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical verification is expensive in terms of time and effort.&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe it takes 5 hours of focused research to verify that wool from a particular alpaca shepherd is ethical because it comes from a legitimately symbiotic relationship between farmer and animals, but it only takes 5 minutes to choose a good plant-based or synthetic alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's a &quot;needle in a haystack&quot; problem to find the ethical products.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, there might be several dozen &quot;free range&quot; egg businesses, but 95% of them do things like killing hens when they stop laying as frequently and killing the non-laying male half of the chicks immediately after sexing. Even if it takes only 10 minutes to check if a given &quot;free range&quot; egg distributor is ethical by the vegan's standard, odds are it would be faster for them to learn how to make/use vegan alternatives like flax eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical animal products are too expensive.&lt;/strong&gt; By the &quot;humans not causing animal suffering&quot; standard, a fully ethical egg farm would have to let all hatched chicks live their full natural lifespans in good environments with plenty of food, space, shelter, and appropriate veterinary care. Just hens laying less frequently as they age could increase the human effort per egg by 2-5x (citation and exact range needed). Then double that due to not killing the entire male half of the population. Then throw in a bit more expense due to roosters being larger and more likely to be territorial. By this point, the fully ethical egg might cost 5-15 times as much as a factory farmed egg, at which point it might be cheaper to just buy a commercial vegan alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vegan's body might have lost its capacity to properly digest animal matter.&lt;/strong&gt; Anecdotally (specific citation needed), I've heard that this is a thing that happens after a couple of years of not processing an entire category of proteins/fats/chemicals. I imagine this is similar to the experience of someone suddenly jumping from a dietary fiber deficit to a surplus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The easiest way to avoid unethical animal products is to avoid all animal products.&lt;/strong&gt; Between the mental cost of finding/verifying ethical animal products and the financial cost of buying them, it could be easier and cheaper to spend 3x as much (relative to factory farmed animal products) on vegan alternatives. A practiced vegan would likely have also have figured out different cooking styles that are even easier/cheaper by simply not calling for animal products in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The question in the vegan's mind is &quot;Why would I use/consume an animal product?&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; By the time someone becomes a vegan, they've already figured out their own reasons why they &lt;em&gt;wouldn't&lt;/em&gt; use animal products. So there has to be a solid reason why they would make an exception. Even if there's a clear and solid quickly-verifiable explanation for why it's ethically permissible by the vegan's standard and it's as cheap as whatever the vegan's already eating/drinking/wearing/using, what's the vegan's incentive to try the animal-derived product that they've long ago stopped thinking of as food/drink/clothing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vegan is too proud of their &quot;vegan&quot; label to give it up for a measly [specific animal product].&lt;/strong&gt; In much of the world avoiding animal products takes some serious effort, especially when lots of packaged foods that look vegan from the picture and product name turn out to have random filler animal products in the ingredients. After spending so much effort learning how to avoid certain products and ingredients, it's easy to lose sight of the original reason (avoiding human-caused animal suffering) and start seeing &quot;being vegan&quot; as more of a personal accomplishment than an effort to reduce suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vegan is too cynical about supposedly ethical animal products.&lt;/strong&gt; After seeing too many &quot;free range&quot;, &quot;grass fed&quot;, etc products still causing animal suffering for the sake of human pleasure, a vegan could believe that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; supposedly ethical animal products are similarly bad for the animals that the products are derived from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vegan doesn't want to change ethically-decided habits unless there's an ethics reason to do so.&lt;/strong&gt; They've likely spent a lot of ethical reflection deciding to become veg*n and even more time thinking thru each personal use of animal products to reach the point of veganism. By that point, unless there's an ethical reason to not only permit but &lt;em&gt;obligate&lt;/em&gt; using the animal product, why make the exception?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vegan is concerned that consuming an ethical animal product will weaken their willpower to resist unethical animal products later.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, if an almost-vegan is used to eating an (ethical) egg with their breakfast each morning, would they be more or less likely than a vegan to order a (likely unethical) poached egg at a lunch meeting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vegan is concerned about what moral message their consumption of an (ethical) animal product will send to people who consume (unethical) animal products.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, wearing an ethical wool hat makes wool hats in general (regardless of ethical status) more fashionable, increasing demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2115" LastActivityDate="2019-02-14T00:30:59.387" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

After all, isn't it better not to have been born than to be born into a life of suffering? Cows used in the dairy industry must be constantly impregnated to keep producing milk, and this means that their calves are taken from them at a very young age so that humans can use the milk. Dairy cows and egg-laying chickens have also been bred to produce debilitating amounts of milk and eggs.

This greatly increases the chances of fly strike because the wool retains dirt and moisture in which blow flies can lay their eggs. The maggots then consume the sheep's flesh. In Australia, a practice called Mulesing is commonly used to prevent fly strike around the hindquarters of sheep. Strips of skin around the rump are cut away, often without the use of anesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my last point: tail docking and castration in pigs.

I would consider it vegan and buy it (in fact I do buy the bar I think you are describing from time to time).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many UK retailers do not bother to label their products as vegan simply because of a general lack of awareness about veganism until recent years. Major ones seem to be catching on little by little, but there are still countless &quot;accidentally vegan&quot; products out there. I find myself reading the ingredients and making a decision simply on that basis a lot of the time. Perhaps also worth noting that I have seen a few reports of products which clearly contained milk or honey being labelled as vegan, so I pretty much always read the ingredients anyway. More scrupulous vegans will look for a trusted trademark like the Vegan Society's, or ask the manufacturer or retailer for information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people and organisations, including the UK Vegan Society, do not consider possible cross-contamination from dairy products or eggs which are not intentional ingredients to make a product non-vegan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/questions/39/is-some-sugar-not-vegan&quot;&gt;possible for sugar not to be vegan&lt;/a&gt;, but that does not seem to be the case for UK products, and would in theory preclude it from being labelled as vegetarian also (considering that alcoholic drinks processed with animal products are not allowed (at least by the UK Vegetarian Society) to be labelled vegetarian).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would caution here that, at least at the time of my most recent visit, the Co-op were selling two Fairtrade branded dark chocolate bars, the 70% cocoa one with no non-vegan ingredients, and the 85% cocoa one including (for some strange reason) milk.

It is best to store nuts whole (either shelled or unshelled) and then process them (eg. shelling, slicing, grinding) at the time they are to be consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oils extracted from nuts and seeds are the most volatile, because they've undergone the most amount of processing and the oils are now directly exposed to air and light. Lipids (fats) may be bound up to proteins or carbohydrates within a whole food and that makes them more stable, but a refined oil comes from breaking those chemical bonds. Extra care should be taken to store oils properly and ensure they are consumed quickly rather than being left on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nutrients in nuts can be further protected by storing them in a dry, air-tight container kept at a cool temperature in a dark space. An air-tight container reduces potential for oxidation, and cool/dry containment reduces potential for hydrolysis, both of which may degrade the oils in nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nuts will have a noticeably unpleasant taste when they've gone rancid.

B12 is mostly gotten from animal products so if you want to follow vegetarian diet that would be your cheese and milk and eggs, but many vegan products such as soy milk and soy yoghurt or non-vegan products, such as breakfast cereals, are usually fortified with B12. Check the label for the information on how well the daily dose is covered by that specific product.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another vitamin that you' like to make sure is more included in the diet you listed would be vitamin D. It can be synthesised by your body from sunlight so if you live somewhere very sunny this might not be such a concern but in general, the vegan foods that are fortified with B12 are fortified with vitamin D as well. If you'll go with vegetarian foods, eggs have quite high levels of vitamin D. A definite must-include are some types of mushrooms such as portobello, shiitake or maitake which are quite high in vitamin D as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for a more exhaustive list of things to watch out for when transitioning diets, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; already has answer for this so feel free to have a look.

In order to achieve consistency you should stop consuming animal products (such as gelatin). On the other hand, one still has to function, but substituting gelatin, leather etc. is a minor sacrifice (this forum has plenty of resources on that).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a final remark I'd like to point out a bias of my logic.&#xA;From reading your question, it seems to me that your &amp;quot;time-to-consequence&amp;quot; is finite, whereas I assumed it to be infinite (or at least no specified end).

They're milked four times a day. One might expect that they'd need to be herded into the barn each of those times, so that they can be milked, but the herders are very gentle about it, and it only takes a few days for most cows to learn the routine after their calves have started feeding less. Frequently, the cows will herd up to the barn before the farmhands even go to start milking, and on an established farm, cows will frequently learn to huddle for milking from following the others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While cows aren't as dumb as we make them out to be, they're also not the brightest of animals; they shouldn't train &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; quickly. They are herd animals, so learning from each other isn't that surprising, but when a new dairy farm is just starting out, and there's only one or two cows that have gotten to the point of producing milk the farmers can take, learning to leave the herd for this is a huge deal. Someone who is more empathic might realize that even being milked four times a day, they experience a significant amount of pain at milking time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This utopian farm also has a couple of serious problems: milking the cows so often is a man-power intensive activity for the amount of milk collected each time, and even with such intensive milking, a dairy cow only gives milk for so long after they give birth. The intensive milking extends it by a significant margin, but it doesn't make the milk keep flowing for the rest of the cow's productive career.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Farms like this probably existed back in the day, but mostly as a farm that raised cows for slaughter, and the dairy was a secondary product, rather than the focus of the farm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next step less humane keeps the calves from their mothers. Instead, they're fed from a bottle. The mothers go on the pumping machines immediately after they start producing milk. The calves get less milk, which means more milk to sell. The calves are slightly malnourished until they're old enough to live on solid foods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Economically speaking, this isn't much better than the ideal. But it's the picture of dairy farming that I was raised to believe when I was a child. At the time, I was living on a farm, and the focus was supposedly more on teaching what farming life was like. But even with that focus, there were details of the neighbor's farming practices that my parents didn't tell me about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next step to making dairy farming profitable is to ship the male calves away to other farms as soon as possible. Many of these calves become veal, so that they don't even have to make it to handling solid foods. Slightly more milk, and the excessive number of male calves is dealt with. At this point, you're killing baby bulls to get the milk they'd have drank. As I understand it, this is the level of ethical of the first pure dairy farms. It's possible that the first farms just raised the male calves to sell to other farms to raise for slaughter as adults, but there was still implicit slaughter as part of this arrangement. The neighbors didn't talk a lot about doing this. When I was a child, I didn't even know what veal was, not even in the item on the menu sense. But I learned it had always been a thing on one of my last visits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But we still haven't addressed the fact that the cows are only giving milk for a few years at a time until they get pregnant again. So now the dairy farmers institutionalize either artificial insemination to keep their cows producing milk all of the time, or they use things like rape racks to hold the cows still so that the farm bull will impregnate them when nature hasn't taken its course quickly enough. There's now an overproduction of both boy and girl calves, so more veal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the reality of the dairy farm &quot;next door&quot; I had been raised to believe was ethical. They used a precursor of a rape rack, but it was still much the same thing; the cow just got a slight amount of ability to evade the bull, rather than no amount. The farmer described it as 'just putting the two &quot;love birds&quot; in a pen and letting nature take its course'. This explanation was given one time we were visiting and this happened to be going on. It was a loud process, as the cow banged into the wooden walls around her repeatedly in her efforts to escape the bull. But the natural process doesn't work 100% of the time, so they still resorted to artificial insemination if that didn't work for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Milking machines reduce the amount of manpower needed to milk the cows. These machines have no ability to sense when they're hurting the cow, so at least the end of each milking experience will be painful, unlike someone milking by hand who could observe the cow to see when it's starting to feel unpleasant and be gentler for the final few squeezes. There's probably more inhumanity with the milking machines than I'm aware of. When our neighbors had been hand-milking while we were over for a visit, the cows still waiting for milking would be making noises that sounded something between a moo and a bellow, which the farmers called &quot;lolling&quot; (I'm not sure about the spelling, I never saw it written.) With the milking machines, at the end of a milking, the cows made a very urgent-sounding bellow which sounded much more distressed than even calf separation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances, a cow's udder can hold more than 6 hours of milk; it's just really uncomfortable for the cow. But you can get more milk per man hour if you don't milk the cows quite so often. It requires more cow rape to make up for the reduction in how long the cow gives milk, but managing that as often as you need to keep the cow producing all the time takes up a lot less time than all that milking. I only know of this from our neighbors discussing the next step to becoming more profitable and not wanting to go there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But modern farms have found a way to do even better than this: milking equipment is just a one time cost, so keep the cows in the barn, in a stall where they can't move pretty much all the time, and you can almost eliminate the cost of your farm hands' milking labors. At this point, milking the cows is just flipping a switch to start, and then flipping it back when too many cows are complaining.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to think that we haven't come up with more inhumane ways to collect milk than this. Unfortunately, I don't have that luxury. It's my understanding that the one less humane way I am aware of to farm dairy has been made illegal, so I don't need to go into it. We've probably come up with something else to get closer to that precipice again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There apparently have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/a/1494/2095&quot;&gt;a few farms that at least came close to the ideal I listed above&lt;/a&gt;. They managed to do this by charging a lot more for the milk they produced and/or making their real money by other means, such as donations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of my knowledge of this is dated; my family moved away from the farm around 1979, and I think the last time I visited those neighbors was 1993 or so. At that point, they had opted to retire the dairy farm, as it was too much work for too little money, and they weren't willing to take the steps to make the operation profitable. It's been my impression that the general trend in the industry was to move increasingly inhumane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2095" LastActivityDate="2019-03-23T20:14:07.690" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

(&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens&lt;/a&gt;) Still according to wikipedia, usage of fire by humans could be as old as 1.7 million years, while more dedicated fireplaces and creation of fire by humans could have appeared between 700 000 and 300 000 years ago. Fire then allowed cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eating non-human milk products is kind of recent in history but has also been extensively used. People were crossing deserts, drinking camel milk, goat cheese and such. Alcoholic beverages have also been very popular, and not only to get drunk: alcohol doesn't spoil like water does, so it's useful for long trips.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The luxury of chosing what foods you would eat came very recently in our history. An optimal nutrition should be very diverse to be sure your body has plenty of possibilities and is not missing anything. Every body is different and needs different foods. The most important is to have enough food to survive, for the rest the body can adapt a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another answer could probably expand on all the types of vitamins and minerals, but I think that's just looking at the same issue but with a microscope, the answer will still be to eat a variety of food. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer your question &lt;em&gt;“Is there anything in meat that isn't available from vegetables?”&lt;/em&gt;, there is &lt;strong&gt;one vitamin that is only exclusively found in animal products&lt;/strong&gt;: B12.

Bei der Bierherstellung werden keine tierischen Stoffe eingesetzt. Das auf dem Reinheitsgebot basierende Vorläufige Biergesetz und die Bierverordnung geben klare Vorgaben für die Herstellung von Bier, wonach tierische Stoffe wie Gelatine oder Hausenblase nicht zulässig sind.

No animal substances are used in the production of beer. The Preliminary Beer Act, which is based on the Purity Law, and the Beer Ordinance provide clear guidelines for the production of beer, according to which animal substances such as gelatine or isinglass are not permitted. What one should know however is that some label glues can contain casein of animal origin (proteins from the milk).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What exceptions should I look out for when drinking beer in Germany?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is also answered on the website:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it permitted to brew beers in Germany that do not comply with the Purity Law?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is an exception for so-called &amp;quot;special beers&amp;quot; in the Act (§ 9 Paragraph 7 Provisional Beer Act). This regulation applies to all federal states except Bavaria. This enables brewers to produce beers with spices such as anise, cinnamon or cloves as well as fruits such as orange or cherry. Well-known beer styles that have always deviated from the strict purity law include Berliner Weiße and Leipziger Gose. According to the existing law, only those additional ingredients may be used that give the beer a special character or taste. Malt or hop substitutes are also not permitted for &amp;quot;special beers&amp;quot;. In addition, it is permitted to deviate from the purity requirement for beers for export. &amp;quot;Special beers&amp;quot; and beers for export that deviate from the Purity Law must be approved by the relevant state authorities. Those who do not brew more than 200 litres of beer per year at home do not have to comply with the Purity Law either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do the same laws apply to German beers produced for export?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is answered above: &amp;quot;In addition, it is permitted to deviate from the purity requirement for beers for export. &amp;quot;Special beers&amp;quot; and beers for export that deviate from the Purity Law must be approved by the relevant state authorities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2216" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-18T08:37:18.697" LastActivityDate="2019-04-11T09:26:27.353" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

For an insect, simply pick it up and put it outside. For a mouse you will need a harmless trap that locks her in a box, and then bring it out to release in a forest many kilometers away from your home. I did that myself, caught 2 mice and released them. Didn't get any new ones since. If they would come back I should take interest in &lt;em&gt;where are they entering from&lt;/em&gt; and make sure to close these holes. Killing or putting poison around the house doesn't really address the source of the problem and is a bit &quot;overkill&quot; for me, I suspect people just get satisfaction from doing violence to a creature that annoys or scares them greatly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the alternative is possible, then how can you justify killing it when it's not absolutely necessary ?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Veganism is about respecting live animals and their right to live a free life. And showing compassion to them. Putting yourself in the shoes of the mouse. It can be more than just deciding what you put in your plate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do what you can, do the best that you can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the way, avoid touching the mouse with your hands, they will bite you if cornered, and they can indeed carry some disease or infectious something. If you trap a live mouse in a box, you will have the chance to observe her alive from a short distance, they have beautiful, big black eyes and they are fluffy, quite cute things they are. I think rats might be more ugly and grumpy but they are still decent fellas. :p&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes on insects:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Insects multiply and coexist in very large numbers, and they are eaten/killed/expended very fast in very large numbers too. They might (speculation) not be very sentient either, some vegans might decide they are allowed to eat insect protein. So, for some, to slap a mosquito that is biting you, or a fly that entered your house doesn't make them feel bad at all, insect life is short. Poisoning a whole area or ecosystem is different. That being said, killing the mosquito while it is draining you might not be the best way to prevent a scratchy bump, I heard it's actually better to let it finish and go away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humans have a good chance to drive mammals, birds or fishes to extinction, but insects, not so easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ants in the house might be an interesting topic too. In this case, killing the ants themselves will do almost nothing, more will come. The real trick is to stop leaving foods and crumbs in the house. Or if you want to keep your crumbs, then you can have a house full of crumbs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; ant-poison, here we see again that killing is not the efficient or smart way to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few spiders or silverfishes in a house shouldn't be a concern, you can let them live.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About killing and violence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Killing and violence is usually fear-driven or panic-driven: punch it until it doesn't move. You can imagine someone wanting to &quot;burn their whole house&quot; because of scary ants or scary mice. Or when someone sees a spider and screams &quot;Kill it, kill it !!!&quot; That's because violence, &lt;em&gt;on the short term&lt;/em&gt;, gets sh*t done, solves the scary problem, &lt;strong&gt;immediatly, for sure&lt;/strong&gt;. At leat it's the impression that it gives. But like we see with killing the ants on the floor, it only gives the satisfaction or seeing one problem (one ant) getting instantly solved, while the underlying issue is still present. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, to be afraid of something so much smaller than you, that doesn't want to harm you at all, is a bit pathetic and shows how much humans live in a disinfected bubble of illusions and reassuring beliefs about hygiene and germs.

That animal won't get the food it needs (since we are taking the milk) and is slaughtered if it's a male (a female baby cow will become a dairy cow). The veal industry benefits greatly from the dairy industry. So even if your only requirement is no animal death, dairy products aren't obtained without victims. Also, the lifespan of a dairy cow is 4 to 6 years. The lifespan of a cow is 18 to 22 years. So even if they aren't slaughtered for their milk, being milked and used like that reduces their lifespan drastically. And those cows will then in turn be sold as ground beef and hamburgers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But also, killing is not the only way to inflict harm:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A calf is taken away from its mother 24 hours after being born. Cows are very attached to their young, being separated from them so soon provokes great distress and emotional harm.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They are isolated inside, barely being able to move.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They're milked while being pregnant.

Or they get the cow pregnant back to back, milking it while it's pregnant, to get the most milk out of it but tiring it out in the process, and killing it at only six years old. Having both a truly ethical and profitable dairy farm would be a miracle.

Long journeys like through-hikes, mountaineering, or voyage by train or ship all have similar requirements so I'll try to provide an answer that works for all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For lightweight food that lasts, the primary objective is to select &lt;strong&gt;dry food&lt;/strong&gt;, for two main reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Weight. Water can contribute a huge amount to the weight of food, but it never contributes to the energy content of food. Consider 100 kcal worth of walnuts and watermelon; 100 kcal of walnuts weighs 15 grams but 100 kcal of watermelon weighs 330 grams. The watermelon weighs 22x more for a given amount of food energy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Decay. Water content of food is a critical factor in determining whether it will decay. High water content greatly increases the likelihood that food will rot, or decompose, or becoming a breeding ground for bacteria or fungus or other organisms. Low water content also helps make food durable against freezing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fats (lipids) are highly desirable in these cases. We might intuitively think of fat as being wet because oils are a liquid at room temperature and fat content is often connected to the perceived moistness of food, but it can really be considered as dry because fats are very lightweight (for a given amount of energy) and don't contribute to decay the same way that water content does.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to finally answer your question, you'll want to select foods that either start with a low water content or are suitable for dehydration to reduce the water content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dry foods: nuts, pulses (lentils &amp;amp; beans), flour-based goods (bread, crackers), candy, dates, grains, refined oils.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Foods that can be dehydrated: most fruit and vegetables, peanut butter, chickpeas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some companies produce entire meals that are already dehydrated.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Butter is very energy-dense and suitable for lacto-vegetarians.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Packaged and powdered foods like Soylent or Huel.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, some of this food is going to take a bit of work to make it palatable. You'll need to work out a plan on how you'll obtain water, and depending on your specific activity, you may also need a way of preparing food to rehydrate it. For alpinism and long hikes, making a stew is one of the easiest ways to rehydrate dried foods. For unsupported journeys in the outdoors, you'll definitely want a water purification system that allows you to use the water you collect along the way. Any water you can get this way is water you don't need to pack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mentioned tofu in your question, but tofu is not a very good choice. Tofu is only about 1.1 kcal per gram, and you really want to be selecting foods that offer at least 3.0 kcal per gram (as a rough benchmark).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1236" LastEditorUserId="1236" LastEditDate="2019-05-25T22:14:12.527" LastActivityDate="2019-05-25T22:14:12.527" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Between those latitudes there is a great deal of agricultural variation, so for the sake of this question I'll assume that 55ºN counts as Nordic country. That still allows a great area of land for domestic production of food, and is indeed where Sweden's centre of agriculture is found.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The climate at this latitude is usually temperate, though in some places will be boreal (sub-arctic). Sweden is temperate in the South and boreal in the North. There is good potential for vegetation and agriculture in a temperate climate, but the sub-arctic climate is probably too hostile to support a healthy plant-based diet entirely on food grown outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The South of Sweden would be classified as a humid continental climate (&lt;code&gt;Dfb&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Köppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; system). This is a climate where forests thrive! And where there aren't forests, it's perfectly possible to grow common cereal grains (eg. wheat, flax, rapeseed, barley, oats, or maize) and vegetables like sugar beet. Sweden even has a long history of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soyinfocenter.com/books/187&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;soy cultivation&lt;/a&gt;.

Some of these health issues very plausibly relate to some of the extreme and unusal things they did, like drinking alcoline water to the point that it probably had an effect on their digestive system. That is just one person. Each youtuber that is prone to trying out extreme things did something different, fasts, eating just one food for a prolonged period of time, etc.  The only pattern is that these are out of the ordinary practices and probably made for good stories.

For the 150 lb person, ze would have to eat like 20 avocados! But, to answer your question, yes, you can get an adequate amount of protein from raw sources alone. The problem is, it will take a lot of time and energy to achieve that goal each day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This seems ridiculous in our society of highly processed foods to eat so much food and spend a lot of time doing so. However, given a different perspective, it isn't so unusual. Think about other primates and herbivores (like cows). What they do most of their day is eat plant matter. I read that those highly muscular mountain gorillas eat 40 lbs of vegetation a day (&lt;a href=&quot;https://seaworld.org/animals/all-about/gorilla/diet/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;). Back as hunter gatherers, I bet humans were similar, spending a huge bulk of the day eating fruits, leaves, flowers, roots, shoots, and stems, in between hunts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, maybe 150 lbs is a lot in terms of the weight of humans through history. People were smaller in the past, and probably needed less protein to be healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A combination of the modern expectation that food consumption be brief and not time-consuming as it was in the past, as well as our heavier weights, make eating enough raw foods to get enough protein every day, unreasonable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be easier to get more protein with cooked plant matter. That is why people mention beans as being good for protein. Edamame, for example, has 18 g per cup. Seeds and nuts, which often need to be cooked to be edible/palatable, also are a good source of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A final note to consider is the idea that people should be eating more insects, such is customary in some countries. Three percent of a gorilla's diet is to eat raw ants, snails, and grubs, and those have plenty of protein. Wouldn't that fit the definition of a raw food diet?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3400" LastEditorUserId="3400" LastEditDate="2019-08-18T19:00:31.470" LastActivityDate="2019-08-18T19:00:31.470" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

However, there is some &lt;a href=&quot;https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2017.72.7735&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; from a recent observational study for an increased lung cancer risk in men who smoke and take high doses over many years. A prudent recommendation is therefore to take a lower daily dose of 10-50 µg. Some plant-based milks, such as soy milk, and other vegan foods may also contain added B12 and provide a sufficient dose if consumed a few times a day. It's a good idea to have your B12 levels checked occasionally, but also MMA (methylmalonic acid) levels to rule out a false negative for B12 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin K2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K2 might be the most neglected vitamin worth supplementing, with evidence for numerous benefits, including skeletal and cardiovascular health and prevention of cancer. There are several forms of vitamin K2. One form, MK-4, can be produced in the human body from vitamin K1, which is found in various plants such as leafy greens. Other forms, most notably MK-7, are made by bacteria during fermentation. The conversion of vitamin K1 into vitamin K2 in the body is probably not sufficient to obtain optimal levels, and there are very few plant-based sources of vitamin K2. Fermented sources like sauerkraut have low levels, and the only reliable plant source with high levels is a Japanese food called “natto”, made from fermented soybeans. Unless you have a ready source of natto and enjoy the apparently peculiar taste, it is recommended to take a daily dose of 100 µg of vitamin K2 daily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Creatine supplementation is not strictly necessary for good health, as the body can produce enough of it itself to avoid any serious consequences. However, vegans and vegetarians do have lower levels than omnivores, and there is clear evidence that supplementation can increase muscle mass and endurance, and possibly reduce depression and improve cognition. Given its low cost, consider supplementing with 5 g of creatine monohydrate daily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taurine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taurine is a non-essential amino acid made by the body. However, it is not found in plants, and levels have been found to be lower in vegans. Higher levels might be helpful for various body functions, including endurance as well as mental health. It is not typically found in multivitamins. You could consider supplementing with 1 g/day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.preventsuffering.org/eating/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.preventsuffering.org/eating/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the article doesn't provide citations, but here are a few references:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin K2: &lt;a href=&quot;https://examine.com/nutrition/supplementing-vitamin-k/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://examine.com/nutrition/supplementing-vitamin-k/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://examine.com/supplements/vitamin-k/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://examine.com/supplements/vitamin-k/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Creatine and muscle creatine and performance: &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijsnem/18/4/article-p389.xml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijsnem/18/4/article-p389.xml&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/14600563&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/14600563&lt;/a&gt;.

I am referring the history of word vegan as stated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionary.com/e/veganism/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.dictionary.com/e/veganism/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, many ethical and health controversies&#xA;surrounding vegetarianism in all its different forms, but we wanted to&#xA;know – where did the words come from? Who invented “veganism”?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vegetarianism has been around for a very long time. Some historians&#xA;date it back to Ancient Greek philosophers, and religious sects of&#xA;Buddhism and Hinduism have encouraged vegetarianism for hundreds of&#xA;years. However, the word itself came into common usage in the 1830s.&#xA;During this era, vegetarianism was associated with religious&#xA;conservatives, some of whom also campaigned for the temperance&#xA;movement to ban alcohol. (To this day, the Church of the Seventh-Day&#xA;Adventists encourages a vegetarian diet.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not completely clear who invented the word “vegetarian.” It may&#xA;have been the founders of the British Vegetarian Society in 1847.&#xA;Regardless, its linguistic roots are very clear. The Latin word&#xA;“vegetābilis” meant “lively or animating” and came to describe foods&#xA;that made one lively or animated. The suffix “–arian” changes an&#xA;adjective into a personal noun, as in librarian or veterinarian. From&#xA;the 1840s onward, the word was in common English usage. (What actually&#xA;makes a vegetable? Or a fruit? Learn more.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why “vegan” though? Where did that short word that connotes radical&#xA;vegetarians come from? Donald Watson, founder of the Vegan Society,&#xA;coined the word “vegan” in 1944 as a statement against vegetarians who&#xA;ate dairy products. He took the first and last letters of the word&#xA;vegetarian to create his orthodox version of vegetarianism. Today, as&#xA;many as 10% of American adults say they follow a vegetarian-inclined&#xA;diet, but only 1% of them are strict vegans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people who describe themselves as vegetarians are technically&#xA;lacto-ovo-vegetarians; that is they eat eggs and milk. If you want to&#xA;get really specific in describing your diet, you could use some of&#xA;these terms: pollotarians (if you eat chicken, but not meat from&#xA;mammals), pescetarians (if you eat fish), freegan (if you eat food&#xA;only when it’s free).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, a new word has entered the dietary lexicon: flexitarian.&#xA;Though the term dates was invented in the 1990s, only in the past few&#xA;years has it acquired common currency. The first flexitarian cookbook&#xA;came out in 2008. Celebrity chef Mark Bittman advocates for a&#xA;“plant-based diet” meaning one that focuses on plants but can include&#xA;a little meat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The word in its purest form is derived from &lt;strong&gt;vegetarian&lt;/strong&gt; which was obviously eating food produced from plants, trees (like fruits, vegetables, beans, pulses etc) and avoiding animal meat, dairy products etc. But in that definition only 1% people fit so they moulded the definition according to themselves rather than following definition in its pure form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lacto-ovo-vegetarians&lt;/strong&gt; is one such word; they want to be accepted as vegetarians, but eat eggs and dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the accepted answer is twisted to get sense even when meat obtained with consent or after death is vegan. No, it is not vegan; it may be ethical to some, but to me if there is no scarcity of food and there is no drought-like situation, eating human meat in any way is insanity &amp;amp; inhumane just like eating other meat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1618" LastEditorUserId="1929" LastEditDate="2023-03-08T20:49:20.387" LastActivityDate="2023-03-08T20:49:20.387" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Therefore in my answer I will focus on animal welfare and ignore the climate change component of the question.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This question implicitly assumes that vegans make up a relatively small portion of the human population. As a thought experiment, let's flip that on its head and assume that &lt;em&gt;everyone in the world&lt;/em&gt; (except you) has already decided to go vegan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, what will be the effect of your donations to vegan advocacy groups? These organizations have one task left as their raison d'être: to convince &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; to adopt a vegan lifestyle. They run advertisements and people knock on your door, but you remain unconvinced. A collective realization dawns: the only solution is to find your price and pay it. Now it's your turn. Name your price, the amount of money that would convince you to adopt a vegan lifestyle forever, and you have the beginning of an answer to your question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's return to the real world where vegans are indeed a minority. Which is the more effective way to reduce suffering -- reducing demand for animal products, or changing the way animals are raised and treated on farms? It is not easy to find an equivalency here because suffering itself is difficult to rank or quantify. And is death considered morally neutral in this question? (In &lt;em&gt;Animal Liberation&lt;/em&gt;, Peter Singer argues that suffering is a well-defined concern, but dying is not.) This kind of question divides animal welfare organizations (eg. RSPCA, Humane Society of US) and animal liberation/animal rights organizations (Animal Defense League, FARM USA) to this day. No amount of math can definitively answer this for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I'll assume the only scenario in which we can easily set up an equivalency -- you want to pay money to an advocacy group so that they can convince somebody to go vegan on your behalf who otherwise would not have done so (demand-side conservation). How much would that cost? Now we are getting close to a well-defined question! But even for organizations that work in this space, that number is quite elusive. Most people do not change their lifestyle after a single interaction with a brochure or a public demonstrator, so the real cost of &quot;making&quot; a vegan is amortized over an unknown number of interactions. And for any given campaign, the number of people who adopt a vegan lifestyle is also likely unknown, unless every person is identified and has a personalized follow-up. Animal Charity Evaluators goes into much more detail about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/methodology/our-use-of-cost-effectiveness-estimates/#3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;challenges in estimating these costs&lt;/a&gt;. I tried (but was unable) to find numbers from Animal Charity Evaluators, Animal Equality, Faunalytics, and the Centre for Vegan Advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it turns out this approach is probably not optimal anyways. Recent findings have &lt;a href=&quot;https://animalcharityevaluators.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/VEBU-report-doc-2016.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that it is more cost effective to convince two people to go 50% vegan than to convince one person to go 100% vegan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if this number were readily available, the problem is further compounded by the fact that most people who originally adopt a vegan lifestyle do not maintain that change, and revert to a diet that more closely resembles the standard diet for their culture and geography. To compute how much it would cost to &quot;maintain&quot; one additional vegan would need to take this into account as well. These are the type of questions that &quot;effective altruists&quot; (a group/movement) are constantly trying to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Effective Altruism is based on utilitarianism, which has its own moral quandaries. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;trolley problem&lt;/a&gt; is one famous example. If there was a scenario where five people could be saved by murdering one, would it be desirable or morally repugnant? This is not purely theoretical -- look closely enough, and you can see many examples of this moral dilemma present in the world today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this answer, I hope to have convinced you that this question is too broad and too complex for the answer to be distilled down to a simple number.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need to decide for yourself if you value the welfare and lives of animals more than you value your unchanged lifestyle. Then live with that, rather than asking how much it costs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;pay away your sins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1236" LastActivityDate="2019-12-12T04:51:07.560" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

But &lt;strong&gt;it's a journey&lt;/strong&gt;, and veganism is about aiming at hurting the smallest possible number of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to maximize your chances of not hurting mice and moles in getting your food, you might want to turn to &lt;strong&gt;organic products&lt;/strong&gt;, which promote biodiversity and reduce the usage of mechanical objects to grow cultures. The most efficient way would be to &lt;strong&gt;grow your own crops&lt;/strong&gt; or buy them from someone who grows small quantities of food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Relation between the neural system and the perception of pain&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; we're still learning about the matter but it's currently globally accepted that the presence of neurons is primordial for living beings to be able to feel pain. Insects do have neural systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While researchers are exploring the possibility of the existence of pain in living beings that do not have a neural system as we define it (e.g. trees), biology commonly accepts that the presence of nerves imply the species is capable of feeling pain (some individuals within those species may not feel pain; this exists in the human species and is known as hyposensitivity): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When we feel pain, such as when we touch a hot stove, sensory receptors in our skin send a message via nerve fibres (A-delta fibres and C fibres) to the spinal cord and brainstem and then onto the brain where the sensation of pain is registered, the information is processed and the pain is perceived.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mydr.com.au/pain/pain-and-how-you-sense-it&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;a href=&quot;https://askentomologists.com/2016/08/29/do-insects-feel-pain/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;targeted research about insects&lt;/a&gt; as well and although entomologists aren't sure they should call it pain, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...] it now appears [...] that a lot of the pathways insects use to &lt;strong&gt;not only sense injury&lt;/strong&gt;, but interpret these experiences, and &lt;strong&gt;respond to that injury are a lot more similar to my pathways&lt;/strong&gt; than I had originally realized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if insects do not feel pain, they still sense injury and react to it in order to protect themselves ... which is a very similar response to what a human would do when feeling pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Are insects able of sentience and/or pain perception?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; Sentience and pain perception are two different things and although there are good chances that the answer is yes, researchers aren't sure yet whether insects are capable of those two things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to outline the fact that feeling pain and being sentient may be interpreted as being two different things. We saw in the first part that insects have a very similar response to injury to what other beings we know to being able of experiencing pain would do. But &lt;strong&gt;are they sentient&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/pets/care-and-welfare/animals-and-people/what-is-sentience&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sentience is actually different&lt;/a&gt; from the ability to feel pain:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Sentience is the ability to perceive one's environment, and experience sensations such as pain and suffering, or pleasure and comfort.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering the aforementioned we can think of pain as a &lt;strong&gt;subset of sentience&lt;/strong&gt;, which I think is an important thing to consider given that your question wonders about whether it's okay to eat insects if they're conscious and/or feel pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a excerpt of what Animal Ethics thinks about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.animal-ethics.org/sentience-section/animal-sentience/what-beings-are-conscious/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;insect sentience&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In the case of insects, we can consider the following line of reasoning, which is an argument by homology. Insects possess a centralized nervous system that is centralized not merely due to the presence of ganglia, but actually includes a brain. It must be noted, though, that it is a very simple and small brain. Therefore, considering insects’ physiology alone is not enough to conclude whether they are conscious or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Nutrition aspects&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; Some articles online promote eating insects because of the allegedly great amounts of important nutrients in them. However, you'll find about the same amount of said nutrients in plants, and given that it's not been proven yet that plants are sentient and/or capable of feeling pain, it's not necessarily more ethical or more effective to turn to insects to &quot;eat healthy&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's no doubt mice and moles get killed because of harvests and crop cultures in today's industrialized world. But is it worth eating insects to avoid killing rodents? If we look at the nutrition facts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edibleinsects.com/insect-nutrition-information/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;edible insects&lt;/a&gt;, you'd need for instance 200g of crickets to get about 30g of protein. That's a fairly good ratio, but not better than what you can get from certain plants (&lt;a href=&quot;https://impactivewellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/plant-proteins.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;you can get the same amount from hemp seeds&lt;/a&gt;, for instance).&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Another thing to consider is that insects are impressively light in weight - you'd need to eat quite a significant number of crickets to get to these 200g.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, there's a certain quantity of fruits and vegetables a human (even a non-vegan one) has to eat to be healthy. No matter how much your dietary plan relies on insects, you'll have to have veggies at some point - and therefore you'd contribute to the deaths of some rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why vegan&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; From a vegan and a philosophical point of view, it wouldn't be effective to eat insects in an attempt of preserving rodents because way more animals would end up getting killed in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if you grew your own produce you'd hurt and/or kill animals because of the changes you impose to the ground. Inverting the soil confuses those of them who live in the ground, you might cut them with the tools you're using, or move them somewhere else where they can't survive. One simply cannot be entirely vegan, even without eating: surveys have shown a human swallows an average of seven spiders per year while sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, veganism is about &lt;strong&gt;aiming at not hurting animals and doing everything you can&lt;/strong&gt; in order to. And if you do want to be vegan, you shouldn't eat insects, because given what we've seen regarding insects sentience and pain perception, it's not unreasonable to believe they're identical to vertebrate animals on those aspects, and &lt;strong&gt;by eating insects you would end up killing many more animals&lt;/strong&gt; than by buying produce for which some rodents have died. If they too are sentient and able to feel pain, then as a vegan you should aim at hurting the smallest possible number of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Parting words&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry I couldn't give you a clear answer on whether insects are sentient and capable of feeling pain. Neural systems are incredibly complex and there's still a lot to discover about those. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pce.13065&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;we're not even sure yet whether plants are sentient&lt;/a&gt; - and they don't have what we call &quot;neural systems&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best you can do if you want to avoid killing rodents is to turn to organic products - they need less intrants and chemicals and therefore fewer insects are killed, and less mechanical tools are used which means less mice and moles are hurt in the process. The very best option would be for you to grow your own crops so that you make sure you're doing the best you can not to hurt animals but it's inevitable that some of them do get hurt and/or die. It's life, if you want to survive you have to go through this.

You will use flour, sugar, water and vinegar to make paper mache glue. You can adjust the recipe as needed to make more or less glue. The basic proportions are 3:1 for the flour:sugar mixture. Use one teaspoon of vinegar for every cup of flour you use.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you want a smoother paste, you can sift the flour before you make your paste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mix one cup flour with ⅓ cup sugar. In a small saucepan, mix the flour and sugar with a spoon or whisk until well-blended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add ¾ cup water and one teaspoon vinegar to the mixture. Blend the mix until it is very smooth and lump-free. It will have the consistency of a thick paste. When smooth, whisk in the rest of the water, ¼ cup to ¾ cup depending on how runny you want your paste, and mix thoroughly. Blend your ingredients until your glue is smooth and a little runny but not watery. Your paste should not be too thick or too drippy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook over medium heat. Pour your mixture in your saucepan and turn on the heat. Stir the mixture constantly until the mixture begins to thicken. Once your mixture starts to boil, you can turn off the heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let your glue cool before using it. When the mixture has cooled, use it for any craft projects including paper mache. Once you have finished, keep any unused glue in a tightly-sealed container in the refrigerator. This glue will keep for 2 to 4 weeks in the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glue something!

On the other hand, you can check for such association in studies in milk consumers or vegans. So, the studies need to include only the actual milk consumers or vegans and not the whole country populations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At least for adults, &lt;strong&gt;milk&lt;/strong&gt; is probably not especially beneficial or harmful for health.

But if you check the below pictures, you can see that in countries with high milk consumption (for example, in Europe), there is a high prevalence of bone fractures and cardiovascular disease. And Russia has a low per capita milk consumption but high prevalence of cardiovascular disease.

Those four factors alone were found found to account for 78 percent of chronic disease risk. If you start from scratch and manage to tick off all four, you may be able to wipe out more than 90 percent of your risk for developing diabetes, more than 80 percent of your risk of having a heart attack, cut by half your risk of having a stroke, and reduce your overall cancer risk by more than one-third.

A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timetocleanse.com/rejuvelac-recipe/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; I read online states that rejuvelac contains B-12.

Heart attacks are part of a broader category called Acute Coronary Syndrome and can be split into three main types:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;coronary spasm, or unstable angina&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;STEMI is often the one people talk about when they say they had a heart attack. It happens when muscles stop receiving blood because a coronary artery got completely blocked. The block is usually due to the presence of fats that stick to the artery walls and prevent the blood from flowing and the effects on the human body are sometimes irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems important to recall the different types of heart attacks because there are many other coronary diseases that may affect a person's life with the same magnitude, but also because studies tend to focus on coronary diseases as a whole when they question the affect of diet on them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Literature&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This study&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from 1990 studied the effects of lifestyle changes on coronary diseases (so they didn't only focus on diet), but it's interesting to notice that they invited patients to have a low-fat vegetarian diet. Here are their results:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, 82% of experimental-group patients had an average change&#xA;towards regression. Comprehensive lifestyle changes may be able to&#xA;bring about regression of even severe coronary atherosclerosis after&#xA;only 1 year, without use of lipid-lowering drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The diet changes were combined to stress management, moderate exercise and smoking avoidance so that gives up hope, but no concrete proof yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily this is a trendy topic in research and many studies were conducted since the previously linked one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one from 2010&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; does not say that a vegetarian diet &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; improves the heart condition but indicates it may help and is a safe way of improving your health:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A carefully planned vegetarian diet with adequate supplementation may&#xA;be effective for primary prevention of heart disease. The vegetarian&#xA;diet is cost effective, safe, and relatively easy to implement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've also found this study from 2017&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, that makes a clear connection between a vegan diet and low levels of cholesterol ... which are partially responsible for artery thickening and by extension, heart issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We've seen so far that a combination of healthy habits does induce a regression in coronary diseases and that vegetarian diets might help reducing heart diseases on their own. As often in science the answer is not a definite &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; but so far, it seems safe to assume that a vegetarian diet does nothing but good to the human coronary system. Let's be good scientists and dig further, shall we? ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't know about it yet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cowspiracy.com/facts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cowspiracy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whatthehealthfilm.com/facts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;What The Health&lt;/a&gt; filmmakers have these great &amp;quot;Facts&amp;quot; pages available online that references every single study they've used to make the movies.

They talk about the effects of eating egg yolk on the carotid walls&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, dairy being the #1 source of saturated fats&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; (which can be responsible for higher cholesterol levels), the concerning amounts of mercury in fish&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (mercury can induce cardiac arrythmia and hypertension, among others) ...

Vegans aren't all bound by the Society, membership isn't a necessity, but many vegans do know the definition of veganism that was crafted in those early years. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to Wren, the original society had more moral interests.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07409710.2019.1646484&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Watson and his predecessors felt sure that the way to humanity’s heart was through its stomach, and they leveraged veganism in hopes of revolutionizing social relations.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07409710.2019.1646484&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, this was in contrast to the radical hopes that underpinned the group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Whether countercuisiniers or moral entrepreneurs, the vegan pioneers carried a radical agenda to challenge the power structures manifest in the state, science, industrialized agriculture, and the Nonhuman Animal rights movement.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07409710.2019.1646484&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the vegan movement was forged with many radical interests that caused factional differences through the years. One notable problem is corporate interest in appropriating the movement. Over the years many vegans have converged on opportunities to exploit their veganism as a means to success.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether the original society equally used veganism unethically as a means instead of an ends might also be debatable. Watson seemed to be a thoroughly genuine character who was willing to undergo great hardship for his cause.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vegansociety.com/sites/default/files/DW_Interview_2002_Unabridged_Transcript.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; During WWII he was a conscientious objector because of the militaries abuse of animals. Watson scraped through those years on his savings, and a small amount of welfare. An outsider implying unethical behaviour or overly radical objectives has a probability of logic flawed by conflation and conjecture. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Veganism is radical by nature of its existence as a counterculture alone. Any vegan that draws radical attention can be claimed to be an attention seeker. Each successive activity of vegans could be confused as the emergence of a new radical vegan faction. No doubt the original style of Watson's people doesn't suit all vegans, but that doesn't rule out the original interests of the early breakaway society. Veganism is equally defined by breaking new ground. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Wren's article and sources for more analysis of the factional changes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3743" LastActivityDate="2020-04-14T02:34:43.350" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It's honest, and if they find that tiresome, that's their problem. At some point, you can call out any ongoing harassment. All you have said is that you want to avoid a controversial subject with the person. You have the right to abstain from any subject, and that has nothing to do with veganism. Etiquette requires that they drop it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This practice also allows you to follow up if you are publicly addressed as &quot;the vegan&quot;. You ask people not to identify your veganism because you don't want the subject mentioned simply to avoid discussing it. Again, the etiquette requires them to drop it. It won't stop everyone, but you can certainly tell when people are passive aggressive over the controversy surrounding veganism. If they hate veganism, and become enthusiastic about discussing it, then you have previously earned an opportunity to demand a way out of being their trapped audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And best of all, any ongoing discussion of your daily practices can be forced into the simpler category of &quot;monkey see, monkey do&quot;.

I grew up in a religion that typically fasts, and became vegan 4-5 years ago and found no physical difference.  The real difference was new mental awareness.  Fasting sort of paused my unintentional acceptance of the cycle of eating, and veganism also paused my unintentional eating of animals.  The more I fast, I realized, the pain of hunger starts mentally long before one's body will actually be in any danger.  And...fasting allowed me the pause in time to see the pain of hunger can subside, and one can just forget about food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of this is a long winded way of me saying, I guess regardless of veganism, or not, leave some integration time before you get back to post-fasting business as usual.  Integrate what you felt during fasting, and let it shine new light on what you need vs. what you want.  Allow yourself to feel gratitude that your elected fasting pain can be lifted at any time, which for some fasting is not elected (starvation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps, sorry if you were looking more for a specific diet add.  I would say after fasting would be a good opportunity to tweak your diet by one item.  Like say I stopped eating lentils after fasting once and was able to perceive I had a lot less gas.

I've tried all the types of blood pressure reducing medication but with no effect. I don't smoke and gave up drinking and smoking in 1994 but started again last year as I would rather live my final years however many they may be doing what makes me happy. But I think my rules of thumb is what have kept me alive when the doctors wrote me off (And are still doing).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have many rules of thumb. &#xA;The milk marketing board, the many food marketing boards like meat and veg are all very powerful and convince us we need 5,7,9,12 (I'm different countries)fruit and veg... and meat and milk and eggs and chocolate and breakfast cereal a day and we buy it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't buy it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Breakfast is the most profitable meal of the day so skip it if you want a healthy bank balance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All dairy products produce a mini high the same as heroin. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meat can change your mind and make you risk your life while simultaneously shortening your life anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything edible has a built in reflex defence attack mechanism that stops you from living solely on it, everything evolves that way for survival. Eat only rabbits and you die of vitamin deficiency,  eat only anything and you will die of something it evolved to kill you for eating it. So to rule number one. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't eat much and vary it. As my mum says 'everything in moderation'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less processed the better if they remove something or add something then we haven't evolved to expect that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't eat breakfast. This is mine as I do intermittent fasting and eat and drink alcohol up to going to bed so my fasting window starts as I go to sleep so must continue as I wake up most mornings. (Some days require a fuck it Eat and cup of tea, not only because I have an autistic daughter and my wife is leaving me)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't eat fruit. Fruit contains fructose, one of the worst sugars for your body and most addictive. It's defence mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give in to what you crave a little now and then. Your body is amazing and has evolved to know what is in each of the foods you have ever tasted and what you are running low on. Also life Isn't  just about health and efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try and eat a rainbow as the vitamins, minerals and micro/macro-biome/nutrients that your body needs to be healthy is all colours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;7.etc&#xA;Future edits to be filled in when I'm not so on my drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3567" LastActivityDate="2020-06-02T19:34:56.843" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

In contrast, dairy calves are typically separated from the cow within hours of birth and then fed milk by bucket or bottle until weaning from milk to solid food weeks later. In this system calves can show a distinctive distress response both when they are separated from the cow, and later when they are weaned from milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2007.03.025&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2007.03.025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;↓&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maria_Jose_Hoetzel/publication/233813901_Understanding_weaning_stress/links/575fcf4c08aec91374b45316/Understanding-weaning-stress.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Claim B&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Young male calves are reared in isolation pens as veal, horned cattle are subjected to disbudding procedures that produce behavioral and physiological pain responses (Stafford &amp;amp; Mellor, 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Claim B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Identifying and preventing pain in animals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P 66 – 67&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;An example from our research group is work on behaviours indicative of pain after dehorning (removal of the horn buds) in dairy calves (Faulkner and Weary, 2000). We were interested in documenting the behaviours shown by 4–8-week-old calves in the hours following the common dairy industry procedure of dehorning using a hot-iron. This procedure is believed to cause severe pain, and is associated with behavioural and physiological responses (e.g.; Morisse et al., 1995; Petrie et al., 1996; McMeekan et al., 1998a). Giving calves a local anaesthetic before dehorning reduces behaviours like tail wagging, head movements, tripping and rearing that typically occur during this procedure. A local anaesthetic also reduces behaviours like head rubbing, head shaking and ear ﬂicking that occur in the ﬁrst few hours after the procedure (Morisse et al., 1995; Sylvester et al., 1998; Graf and Senn, 1999; McMeekan et al., 1999). Unfortunately, local anaesthetics like lidocaine are only effective for about 3 h after they are administered (e.g. McMeekan et al., 1998a,b). Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to be effective at reducing post-operative pain in the hours that follow the procedure, but are these same behavioural measures valid indicators of pain over this period?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P 67&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In our experiment we gave all calves a local block with lidocaine, and provided a pre-operative sedative to reduce the response to the injection of the local anaesthetic and eliminate the need for physical restraint during the procedure (see Grøndahl-Nielsen et al., 1999). Calves were then either dehorned or a put through a sham procedure (P versus p), with or without the NSAID ketoprofen (A versus a). The number of ear ﬂicks shown by calves during the 24 h after the procedure is illustrated in Fig. 1. Calves that experienced the sham procedure with or without the NSAID showed almost no ear ﬂicks, as did calves that were dehorned and received the NSAID. However, calves that were dehorned without the NSAID showed high frequencies of this behaviour throughout the 24 h after the procedure, demonstrating that this response is indicative of post-procedural pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/2TPjF.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/2TPjF.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Weary et al., 2006&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2006.04.013&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2006.04.013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;↓&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;amp;httpsredir=1&amp;amp;article=1002&amp;amp;context=assawel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Claim C&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;during transport to slaughter, cows routinely are subjected to hunger, thirst and bodily harm, to name just a few conditions these animals regularly endure (Knowles, Warriss, &amp;amp; Vogel, 2014; Weary, Niel, Flower,&amp;amp; Fraser, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are all uninstantiated claims (for this quote). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3424" LastActivityDate="2020-06-06T20:16:37.823" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Pole and line is the most sustainable method, as it minimises capturing endangered species, non-relevant species (dolphins, sharks) and damaging the ocean floor which methods like trawling will do. Farming may be better still from an environmental damage perspective, although I'd need to look into that further.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How do you source meat, fish and plants? Switching to veganism reduces a lot of the greenhouse gases produced by livestock but if you're then eating fruit and veg that has a load of air miles, it's not going to be as big of a carbon saving as buying locally (although probably never enough to make it worse than eating meat)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What plants do you switch to eating? For example, avocados are linked with large-scale rainforest destruction, and rice paddies produce methane. Similarly, sticking to oat milk uses less water than soy milk. Are you buying organic, or are these grown using pesticides? There are a few factors here although, again, probably not enough to be more damaging than eating meat&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What fish do you switch to eating? While cod is a commonly eaten fish, its wild populations are under significant threat from the fishing industry. Sticking to species like Salmon (often farmed instead of caught from the wild) and Pollock (which have healthier natural stocks) will be better from an ecological perspective. Better still, animals like oysters and mussels are farmed (so no negative impact on marine wildlife) and actually have a positive environmental impact due to their water filtering habits&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How is food packaged? Compare picking up stuff from a market to it being wrapped in cellophane from the supermarket. Plastic doesn't biodegrade and has significant ecological consequences. This also applies to restaurants and takeaways that you are buying from in both scenarios (I know anecdotally that vegan places are more conscientious when it comes to packaging)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How is food stored and cooked? Think about the energy required to freeze/chill and cook food in both scenarios. This will depend on your location - I'm in the UK so fruit and veg don't need to go in the fridge or freezer the way that meat and fish would need to&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I imagine a lot of these questions will be relevant for understanding the health impact as well, but I'm not as well educated on that side of things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, a pescatarian diet has a much lower ecological impact than being an omnivore, and a vegan diet has a lower ecological impact still. Given that 'ecology' has so many parts to it (environmental damage, carbon production, pollution...) there is no easy answer. However, while there is no 'definitive' answer, hopefully these things will help you decide a lifestyle that's right for you and sits well with your values.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3845" LastActivityDate="2020-06-15T15:21:51.207" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

To summarize:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Acquiring pet chickens is problematic because hen breeders kill male chicks (~50% of the chicks they hatch), since they can only sell females.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hens have been bread to lay an unhealthy number of eggs per year. Wild chickens lay 12 eggs per year, while domestic chickens lay 250. Laying so many eggs takes a lot of nutrients from the chickens, in particular calcium. Chickens can eat their own eggs to get back some of those nutrients, or they can be given birth control so they stop laying eggs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hens stop laying many eggs after 1 to 2 years, but they can live up to 8 years. Many people kill their hens after they stop laying many eggs. Obviously, this is avoidable if you are responsible for the chickens.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eating eggs from backyard chickens can send the wrong message. It can indicate that you consider it okay to eat eggs from &amp;quot;humane&amp;quot; sources. However, even chickens at certified &amp;quot;humane&amp;quot; farms are still raised in terrible conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't personally think all of these points are equally convincing, but some of them are strong enough that they'd prevent me from eating eggs from pet chickens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From an environmental point of view, eggs from backyard chickens will be less efficiently produced than eggs from a factory farm, egg for egg, since they won't benefit an economy of scale. So if you don't eat factory farmed eggs for environmental reasons, it makes even less sense to eat eggs from backyard chickens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1250" LastEditorUserId="1250" LastEditDate="2020-07-30T12:15:43.303" LastActivityDate="2020-07-30T12:15:43.303" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Cooking (especially in water) destroys resistant starch, but it re-forms to some extent after cooking and cooling potato (as with pasta - I think that's why you're supposed to eat pasta as soon as possible after cooking, because it hardens due to the resistant starch re-formation) so eating cooked potato before it cools down would help. Soaking potato in water before cooking removes some of the starch (this also makes it easier to pan fry the potato as it does not stick as much). Boiling potato and discarding the cooking water removes even more starch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cooking foods pretty much eliminates the vitamin C, which is destroyed at around 45 degrees Celsius. It would be easier to get vitamin C from other sources such as raw capsicum and other salad veg, and fruits like strawberry, kiwi, pineapple and citrus.

This is one of the best luxuries of cycling vs trekking: bread.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bread Protip: Buy a loaf of bread, a bunch of bananas, and a jar of peanut butter. Make peanut-butter &amp;amp; banana sandwiches out of the entire loaf, then put the sandwiches back in the bread bag. If you have a handlebar bag, you can eat the sandwiches while you ride.

In regular kibble, many of these nutrients are stripped away during processing and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.purinaone.com/ingredients#taxonomy-term-736&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;added back in from synthetic sources&lt;/a&gt;.

Vegan diets are typically more alkaline/basic (high pH) than meat based diets. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/vegan_cats&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Basic diets can cause FLUTD (feline lower urinary tract disease), especially in male cats&lt;/a&gt;. To combat this &lt;a href=&quot;http://vegepets.info/diets/veg-feline.html#urinary-alkalinisation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;their food must be acidified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most vegan and non-vegan cat kibble is acidified to prevent this condition.

A pH &amp;gt; 7 indicates alkalinity. A variety&#xA;of dietary products (e.g., “Vegeyeast” from Harbingers of a New&#xA;Age—see [26]) and additives can correct alkalinization, should it&#xA;occur. Asparagus, peas, brown rice, oats, lentils, corn, brussel&#xA;sprouts and yeast may be included in feline and canine diets, and are&#xA;all urinary acidifiers [27]. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is also a&#xA;urinary acidifier. The British Small Animal Veterinary Association&#xA;(BSAVA) Small Animal Formulary [86] recommends a dosage of 50–80 mg/kg&#xA;every 24 h for cats and dogs. And for more serious cases, the amino&#xA;acids methionine and cysteine may be used &lt;a href=&quot;https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B0048ZE5SG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;. The BSAVA Small Animal&#xA;Formulary [86] recommends a dosage of 200 mg/cat every 8 h.

Some vege sources do not not have all the various aminos in balanced quantities (but many do, like quinoa or tofu), BUT this doesn't mean you've got to match them up with other sources that fill in the missing aminos to balance it out for every single meal, which is what some sources erroneously suggest! (e.g. beans + rice etc). The body will just store any spare imbalances of amino acids and make them into your meat when the missing aminos arrive at some later point.  So if your overall diet contains a variety of vegan proteins (not necessarily in the same meal) you will be just fine.  Even if you don't, no problem; just might need to eat more food (lucky you).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I probably eat more protein now and I barely eat any meat. I actually mostly stopped eating meat just out of convenience because it's too messy and perishable.  Essentially I learned to make vege proteins taste good and then meat became a waste of money and time going to supermarket so I stopped getting it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to figure out which high protein vegan sources work for you&lt;/strong&gt;  and make sure you replace any meat you ate before with these. If that is still not enough, add in high-protein snacks and carb replacements like I mention below. You can easily eat even MORE protein than before once you work it out!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My main sources are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tofu. Cooks fast if sliced thin. Usually with a stir fry.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nuts and seeds in my smoothie/snacks/desserts&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Switch to moderate protein snacks (e.g. forget potato chips and crackers, instead look for snacks like papadoms, bujah mix etc; these are great ways to sneak in extra protein which seriously adds up. Indians seem to be good at this.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Moderate protein flours (e.g. buckwheat, amaranth and various Indian ones, but not wheat) which I can rapidly cook into pan breads when needed. I don't bother with loaves of bread (too perishable). Again, like snacks, this adds up.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pea protein shake (20g complete protein in a glass of water for $1... beats every form of meat easily).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Various lentils and beans. Many can be made complete proteins simply by eating with rice. I'm not a big bean fan, and actually they are not that high in protein compared to lentils. Mainly I do split mung beans as they are dirt cheap, and easy to cook and digest.  Just throw them in with the rice in a pot.  Make a little tomato-onion curry sauce to pour over and done.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;High protein pastas and noodles. This is a relatively new thing. My local supermarket now has a fairly good selection of these. They are super convenient being non perishable and contain so much protein you do not need to add any additional protein sources to your meal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are making your own meals most of the time, you can easily jack up the protein to insane levels with items like these if you wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I started going to the supermarket infrequently and hence ate much less meat, I felt &amp;quot;weak&amp;quot; and wanted to buy it again, but instead I just jacked up the vege proteins to higher levels, learned to make them taste better (pro tip: learn to use Asafoetida or other umami sources) and got over my emotional attachment to meat and then never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However... the problems begin when you eat out&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are this kind of person, then you can't control what vegetarian food restaurants offer, and honestly it tends to be not well thought out and lacking in protein by default.

Whole foods plant and natural animal sources provide all of&#xA;the essential amino acids. Near-complete proteins are also found in&#xA;some plant sources such as quinoa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The net protein utilization is profoundly affected by the &lt;strong&gt;limiting&#xA;amino acid&lt;/strong&gt; content (the essential amino acid found in the smallest&#xA;quantity in the foodstuff), and somewhat affected by salvage of&#xA;essential amino acids in the body. It is therefore a good idea to mix&#xA;foodstuffs that have different weaknesses in their essential amino&#xA;acid distributions. This limits the loss of nitrogen through&#xA;deamination and increases overall net protein utilization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following table of &lt;em&gt;protein source&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;limiting amino acid&lt;/em&gt; is then provided:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&quot;s-table-container&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;table class=&quot;s-table&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;thead&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;th&gt;Protein   source&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;th&gt;Limiting   amino acid&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/thead&gt;&#xA;&lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;Wheat&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;lysine&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;Rice&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;lysine&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;Maize&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;lysine and tryptophan&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;Legumes&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;methionine/cysteine pair and tryptophan&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;Egg, chicken, milk&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;none; egg is   the reference for complete protein&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The article continues:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The amino acid distribution profile is less optimal in plant foods&#xA;than in animal foods. but it is not necessary to consume plant foods&#xA;containing complete proteins as long as a reasonably varied diet is&#xA;maintained.

The argumentation is far less complicated and the outcomes look great as an intermediate step.

Namely, I had assumed that a great majority of the well-educated people who started to eat certified products would stick to it for the sake of the animals or their own well-being (these products tend not to have antibiotics/hormones). However, as Alex points out in his blog post, there is no hard commitment from the part of ethical omnivores, as can be seen by an almost inexistent community built around it. For this reason, they are more likely to only respect their decision from time to time, or worse, to quit it entirely (one driving factor for it may be high prices). This conclusion undermines my question in two ways: first, it is likely (and I am starting to notice it now) that this light weight decision - that is, to exclusively buy certified products - will not bring people to reflect about the conditions of animals; second, as it is probably the case that not many people will become committed to buying certified products, the need for us activists to optimize the hole situation, i.e., to make sure the suffering incurred by these products is minimized as much as possible (requirements and monitoring are the strictest possible), becomes less important. Nevertheless, since these products will still be bought in non neglectable amounts (the amount of research animals that suffer from exploitation is orders of magnitude less than the amount of animals that suffer from the meat industry, but we fight for their well-being nonetheless), I take the time to answer my latter question in the negative: animal liberation activists (mainly vegan/vegetarian) probably can't do much to improve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In what ways could an animal liberation activist pressure certification programs to do their jobs better? Besides the usual protesting, which I think will go on in a way that is independent of certification programs (the rights we claim such as minimum standing areas and less invasive procedures apply to all farms, not just factory farms), the only other way I can think of is economical pressure. That is, to make pressure by not buying products from weakly certified brands. However, most of us activist wouldn't be buying them anyway (there are those who acknowledge the issues of factory farming but still desire to eat meat, however, as we said, they are either a minority or not as dedicated to the cause as would be necessary to implement change). Thus, I don't see anything unique to certified products that would compel exclusive action/consideration from the part of activists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: I am still curious about my first pair of questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4877" LastActivityDate="2021-08-07T00:55:38.873" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

By the time the rice is adequately cooked (I'm sure you'd find undercooked rice uncomfortable to eat), the masoor dal is, as far as I'm concerned, perfectly adequately cooked, although the grains are still distinct.*&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Masoor dal does not contain any toxic substances such that eating it lightly cooked would be unsafe. Note that raw, sprouted masoor dal is a popular snack and salad ingredient (sprouting does break down some of the substances that make pulses and other seeds difficult to digest, though - I expect one would feel uncomfortably bloated after eating completely raw dal). Also, pressure cooking involves the food reaching very high temperatures such that the very vast majority of harmful microorganisms that might be present would be thoroughly destroyed by the process, if that's a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Masoor dal does contain resistant starch, a type of starch that can't be digested by human digestive enzymes and so generally gets fermented by organisms in the gut, which can produce gas. Resistant starch is broken down by prolonged cooking in excess water. So eating masoor dal cooked in the way you describe might lead to mild digestive discomfort for some people.

Phytate levels in food are reduced by cooking, but you can more effectively reduce them by soaking in slightly acidified water (add a drop of lemon or vinegar) for preferably a few hours (I keep things I am soaking in the fridge as it is very hot here and they can start to get fermented otherwise) and draining before cooking.

And in many places all of the water that is consumed by ruminants is just rain that would fall there anyway, but in other places they will be diverting from fresh water sources.  Likewise in New Zealand all the cows eat grass that grows there anyway, but in USA, most of the beef is grain fed and those grain need additional resources to grow.  Mind you, grass fed beef has its own issues like poluted waterways and more methane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise health claims such as beef being &amp;quot;as bad as smoking&amp;quot; may only apply to grain fed beef which has 10x the omega 6 ratio of grass fed beef, therefore people in countries which only have grass fed beef may be much safer from meat enduced early death.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4833" LastActivityDate="2021-08-19T08:11:06.073" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Last week one of my zucchini plants was covered in Squash Bug eggs and recently hatched ones. I know that if left unchecked, they'll decimate not just that plant, but several neighboring plants. So what I did was cut off any leaf with the bugs on them, and buried the leaves in the compost pile to prevent spread to other plants. From the heat of the middle of the compost pile, this most likely killed all of the squash bugs. After doing this, I realized that I should really try to find a better way to deal with something like this, that doesn't involve out-right killing them all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm looking to see if anyone's got suggestions for ways to deter initial infestations of plants, without killing bugs that come in contact with the plant. I wouldn't want to spray everything with a chemical that would then kill bees, butterflies, hoverflies, and other pollinators, but I want to keep the more harmful insects away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="20" LastEditorUserId="1236" LastEditDate="2021-08-20T03:56:17.643" LastActivityDate="2021-09-09T12:02:23.563" Title="Non-Lethal Pest Deterrents in a Home Garden" Tags="|veganism|subsistence-farming|pest-control|vegan-gardening|" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The act made it economically unfeasible to raise cattle for 12 years before slaughter. On 29 September 2020, the cabinet approved the proposal on banning cattle slaughter permanently from the country.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Animal Act also made it difficult to provide dairy.

This though might bring us to a situation similar to viscose which is made from plant and wood fibres, but where some have been concerned about chemicals used in in the manufacturing process. The raw material itself is natural and of course causes no animal deaths. However chemicals used might harm the environment (including wildlife) and might further introduce some element of toxicity in usage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However there's a further negative point to the historical rexine which has me drop the possibility of it being useful altogether. The finish of cellulose nitrate is extremely flammable and therefore quite a dangerous fabric to use, having the potential to enable a small flame or burn to spread very rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This refers to the original, trademarked rexine, which I doubt is actually made anymore, though might still be made on demand by some producers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that most modern leathercloth fabrics today which are called rexine are not the cellulose based, trademarked original and are likely to be more typical faux leather.

A wheat farmer would not &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; rats to produce wheat. If they are present, it's a challenge that they have to deal with. This is why I prefer to stick to the dictionary definition of vegan, which is someone who avoids products where animals are &lt;em&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; used to make them. So that means things like meat, dairy, eggs, honey, leather, fur, etc. People who do that can call themselves vegans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the other considerations stem from the fact that vegans are conscious about  the impact they have on animals and the environment, and everyone tries their best to go a step further to minimize their footprint on the world around us. I think the attitude should be to applaud positive changes but not expect, judge or compare vegans to see who goes the furthest. Because we have to remain practical, and making it too difficult to be a vegan might just deter some people from considering veganism, and continue to consume animal products which is more harmful to animals and the planet in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As humanity moves towards a plant based diet, we will live more in harmony with nature, and many of these issues will be naturally resolved.

Animal agriculture contributes to climate change which causes extreme weather events, loss of habitable and cultivable land and habitats.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not having enough to eat is bad. Animal agriculture consumes more resources so that some humans can't get enough food (climate change is a factor here too).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think there's much mileage in arguing about whether vegetarianism has a history (it does, but in my opinion that does not make it morally good, though examining the way people have reasoned about it in that history may certainly yield useful moral arguments) or whether humans are adapted to eat meat (whether we are or not, we seem to have done so for thousands of years and historically benefited from doing so in areas where arable land is scarce - denying this is just silly - but it does not follow that all humans must or should eat meat - clearly we can survive and thrive without it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;* I do think it's okay to eat meat for survival, and I'm not much inclined to criticise practices like hunting wild animals for food.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="74" LastEditorUserId="74" LastEditDate="2021-10-19T12:41:37.270" LastActivityDate="2021-10-19T12:41:37.270" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Also, a significant number of people live in regions/societies where avoiding meat might leave them with an insufficient diet because there are very few plant foods available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on places where almost everyone could easily become vegetarian if they wanted to, there would need to be significant cultural shifts for them to do so. Here are some examples of factors that might prevent people from giving up meat:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People often value their traditions and customs especially with regard to food. The pleasure of eating familiar dishes cooked to an old family recipe, or tasting regional delicacies on holiday make it uncomfortable to imagine eliminating key ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People might want to consume meat because of its association with wealth and status, or to affirm their non-vegetarian identity (this is notable in India where many people rarely eat non-veg for economic reasons, and attitudes towards vegetarianism carry connotation of caste discrimination).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, with increasing awareness of the contribution of animal agriculture to climate breakdown, there has been an increase in people giving up meat and other animal products, at least in some countries. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/general-faqs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The UK Vegan Society found that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the number of vegans in Great Britain has quadrupled from 2014 to 2019. The numbers rose from 0.25% (150,000) of the population in 2014 to 0.46% (276,000) in 2016 to 1.16% in 2019 (600,000).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Note: vegans do not consume (or use) any animal products - this is more comprehensive than vegetarianism.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has called forth a backlash, with meat producers campaigning heavily to keep meat on people's tables. It's widely known that cattle farming is the main driver of rainforest destruction and murder and displacement of tribal people in South America (though mining and other industries are involved), but these days I see many newspaper and magazine articles (often issuing directly from meat farmers) pushing the idea that meat is good for the environment and it's vegans who are destroying biodiversity and rainforests and dispossessing indigenous people by eating soya or avocados. (In case it's useful to anyone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plantbaseddata.medium.com/the-failed-attempt-to-greenwash-beef-7dfca9d74333&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this review&lt;/a&gt; examines one farm's &amp;quot;carbon negative beef&amp;quot; claims).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This backlash is a good sign - it shows that the meat market is under pressure - but it also shows that people like me who would like to see the present forms of commercial animal agriculture (&amp;quot;factory farming&amp;quot;) disappear as the majority of humans who can do so stop eating animals are up against powerful interests as well as cultural traditions and personal preferences. If commercial animal agriculture is really to be stopped or immensely downscaled, I think there is indeed a long slog ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, accepting the position that all humanity is not imminently about to become vegetarian does not require us to accept that becoming vegetarian is somehow wrong or futile. Even a single person abstaining from meat-eating has a real impact.

Cyanocobalamin is converted into methylcobalamin or adenosylcobalamin inside the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While there is some evidence that cyanocobalamin is slightly more readily absorbed from the gut than methylcobalamin, this is likely more than compensated for by the fact that cyanocobalamin is more readily excreted in urine than methylcobalamin, and so less well retained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven't seen any supplements in the form of adenosylcobalamin, and I'm not aware of its specific benefits, if any.

I’m not&#xA;familiar with a recommendation of 5-10 mcg from a supplement due to&#xA;poor absorption.  There can be issues with digestion and absorption of&#xA;B12, primarily as we age.  It tends to be food sources that are more&#xA;problematic in terms of digestion with aging.  Supplement B12 is&#xA;actually potentially better absorbed since there is no digestion&#xA;(release from the food source eaten) needed.  However, there can be&#xA;issues with absorption of even supplemental B12 due to a decrease in&#xA;the stomach factor needed to assist the absorption, known as Intrinsic&#xA;Factor (IF).  These reasons are why for those over 51 years of age and&#xA;those that may have trouble digesting and absorbing B12 from the food&#xA;they eat,  it is recommended to get this amount of  vitamin B12 from&#xA;fortified foods (foods to which it has been added when processed like&#xA;some breakfast cereals), nutritional yeasts, or from supplements. You&#xA;will commonly see very large amounts of B12 in supplements.  Since it&#xA;is considered non-toxic at even larger doses, it is not a concern for&#xA;most people and may actually help overcome some of the lack of&#xA;intrinsic factor if present.  In cases when B12 can’t be digested and&#xA;absorbed, that is when a health care provider might recommend&#xA;injections, which then bypass the gastro intestinal system and go&#xA;directly into the body, ready for use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to your question about nutritional yeast being a supplement or a&#xA;food. Nutritional yeast is considered at food product/food additive&#xA;(and as you noted,  can be a source of Vitamin B12 if it has been&#xA;added to (fortified) the product…check the ingredient list on the&#xA;product for the addition of B12).  It is marketed as a seasoning or&#xA;often as an addition to vegan food/dishes.  If it is provided in&#xA;tablet form, which is also on the market, then it is more a supplement&#xA;and as such has a “Supplement Facts” label on it.  If you see a&#xA;“Nutrition Facts” label on the product, this indicates it is&#xA;considered a “food”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have specific concerns about your own vitamin B12 status please&#xA;talk with your healthcare provider as they can assess and make&#xA;recommendations if needed.

Methylcobalamin has a much higher absorption rate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be aware, however, that some companies in Asia market a supplement under the name of &amp;quot;Mecobalamin.&amp;quot;  This makes one think it should be methylcobalamin, but, and assuming they knew the truth, the pharmacists informed me that it was actually hydroxocobalamin...tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some believe that adenosylcobalamin is the best form, but in reality, both it and methylcobalamin are used in the body.

Essentially, the body is limited with how much it can absorb at one time.  The limit is on account of the availability of intrinsic factor.  Older individuals produce less intrinsic factor, and people with certain health conditions may produce less as well.  Without intrinsic factor, B12 cannot be absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 is the largest vitamin, size-wise.  In order for it to pass through the lining of the intestine, the intestinal wall must open a special hole for it to pass through, then close the hole again afterward to prevent the entrance of bacteria.  It is intrinsic factor that causes this opening.  Because of this, one can consume ever so much B12 and not absorb any of it if the intrinsic factor is lacking.

Then they will overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Watermelon and lettuce may have very low nutritional density, while seeds/nuts/grains/beans/avocado may have very high.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer the question &lt;em&gt;whether vegans need to eat more food&lt;/em&gt;, I'd say it really depends with what you compare with.&#xA;You can be a vegan who eats only salads and raw foods OR a junk food vegan that drinks cola, eats fries with ketchup and (vegan) mayo. These are of course extremes, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eating a balanced diet composed of variety of foods is probably the best way to go, and I wouldn't worry much about the quantities.&#xA;If you are still curious, you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Daily Dozen&lt;/a&gt; app (both available for android and ios). There is a check-list of daily food recommendations for optimal health. It should give you an idea for the quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1033" LastActivityDate="2022-03-14T14:48:21.980" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If the quality is good enough you can mix 100g with 1 liter water to make hemp milk. Unfortunately most available seeds are not of a very good quality and contain some acid that is kind of bitter, so you have to add more water (ratio 1 to 15) to be able to enjoy it. Or you add some dates into the mixer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;press cake of peeled hemp seeds&lt;/strong&gt; - more than 60-70% protein. Difficult to get though. Most of the hemp protein powders are made of press cake from whole hemp seeds which contain huge amounts of some disgusting acid.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dry nettle&lt;/strong&gt; contains 50% protein. If the quality is good enough I consume 100g of it per day. I put 100g and 1000ml of water into high speed mixer and let it go for one minute (you can add some ice cubes to keep cold) and then I pass it through a nut milk bag. If it's too bitter some more water.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seitan or gluten can be used to make some tasty dishes but shouldn't be considered as a protein source. Even natural wheat has a very low content of Lysin. But when gluten gets washed out from wheat grains it loses even more of it and contains 5 time less of it then soy protein isolate (not to mention you feel like sh*t if you consume daily higher amounts of gluten)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5471" LastActivityDate="2022-04-19T05:52:43.103" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

For the whole process, you only need 1 additional ingredient, vegan yogurt starter. I use an Instant Pot brand pressure cooker to sterilize and ferment. Any pressure cooker with a yogurt function would work. In warmer climates, you could probably get away with leaving it on the counter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shelf-stable high protein soy milk&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vegan yogurt starter culture&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Soy Milk&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; soy milk is the key to the whole procedure. Once you have access to that, it's a piece of cake. I'm lucky, because it's available within walking distance of my apartment. You want something that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Contains as few ingredients as possible, especially no emulsifying agents or thickeners (like lecithin or gums). Ideally you want soybeans and water.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is high in protein, this makes the yogurt thick after fermentation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.westsoymilk.com/products/organic/organic-original/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The kind I use&lt;/a&gt; has 3.8g protein per 100mL. Compare that to soymilk in the refrigerator section with 2.9g/100mL.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is shelf stable. These products are highly pasteurized which ensures there are no other bacteria / yeast to out compete your culture.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Starter culture&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://culturesforhealth.com/products/vegan-yogurt-starter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cultures for Health&lt;/a&gt; brand starter culture (obviously I have no affiliation). I'm sure there are other brands that will work just fine. The package came with 4  sachets. After 2 years, I've only used one (see below). For the first time, you can suspend the culture in a small amount of soy milk and distribute it evenly between jars. I used one packet for 950mL (32oz) the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Preparing the fermentation vessels&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ballmasonjars.com/products/jars/canning-jars/mason-jars-lids%2C-wide-mouth%2C-pint-%2816-oz.%2C-12-pack/SAP_66000ZFP.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;wide mouth mason jars&lt;/a&gt; to ferment my yogurt.

This ensures there are no other bacteria in the containers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Inoculating the soy milk&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Allow the containers to cool down such that you can touch them. The room temperature soy milk has enough thermal mass to decrease the temperature enough such that the culture won't be harmed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fill the mason jars about 80% full with soy milk. Try not to stick your finger or anything else that's dirty into the soy milk.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Using your sterilized spoon, scoop a small amount (say 30mL or 2tbsp) of your previous batch of yogurt into the soy milk.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stir to ensure the old yogurt (and its good bacteria) is well dispersed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fill up the jar as needed with extra yogurt&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Fermentation&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Transfer the filled / inoculated jars to the Instant Pot&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No need for the lid&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Close the Instant Pot and ferment using the yogurt setting for as long as you like. The longer you ferment, the more tangy it gets. I ferment for 14 hours.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove the yogurt from the instant pot, place the sterilized lids on the jars and transfer to the fridge.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The result is very thick yogurt. After a few days, a bit of clear liquid will separate from the &amp;quot;curd&amp;quot; that can be poured off to further thicken the yogurt. The cost of the soy milk + electricity is about the same as cow milk yogurt (although cow milk is highly subsidized in the US).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I typically make 4 jars. When 3 have been opened, I use the first bit of the 4th unopened jar to inoculate the next batch. This decreases the risk of contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use it to make all sorts of recipes that include yogurt including tzatziki and south Indian curd rice.

For example, no animal products once a week, then twice a week, and so on, until you reach your goal. Ready-made meals can help, there are plenty of good options in the supermarket. Another is to simply replace the animal ingredients in whatever you usually prepare, with a plant based alternative. Again, your supermarket or health store should have plenty of vegan alternatives for meat, chicken, eggs, milk, ham, cheese, ice-cream, etc. Organic soya chunks and tofu are also easy to use as meat replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's true that it's best not to rely too much on processed foods, but in my opinion, I think that the ingredients are the most important. If you find a processed meat alternative with natural ingredients, I think it's still healthier than eating the animal based counterpart. That said, fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, with plenty of raw food, preferably organic, should still constitute the majority of your diet. Eventually you will find that you won't need any animal products and the vegan alternatives for them will be optional too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I happen to love Indian food, and all Indian restaurants I've visited around the world have plenty of vegan options, so that's a good one for takeaways.

It might also give you some ideas on what to cook.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooking tips&lt;/strong&gt;: If like me you don't have much time to follow recipes, you can quickly improvise by mixing a starchy food with a protein rich food. For example: pasta/rice/potatoes/quinoa with beans/peas/lentils/chickpeas. These dishes, such as potatoes with canned beans, can be done quickly and cheaply. Throw in whatever veggies you have around, steamed, roasted, stir-fried or raw.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My method is to randomly add a variety of herbs and spices for flavor and extra nutrition, without following any rules or measurements. I cannot remember any meal that didn't taste good after that. Some of my favorites are mixed herbs, parsley, oregano, cumin, curry powder, turmeric, smoked paprika, ground ginger, and of course, soy sauce. Have fun experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, you might want to join groups that will encourage you or give you tips.

Don't forget to listen to your body and talk to your doctor about any deficiencies and how to adjust your diet or supplement accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5808" LastActivityDate="2022-11-04T17:12:10.880" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It can only be formed by a few bacteria that almost all live in the intestinal flora of animals, but that means you can also find it in other animal products like milk or eggs. You can also find it in some kinds of seaweed but I think this is the only plant that contains it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you are a vegetarian who still eats eggs and consumes dairy products, you still absorb some Vitamin B12. As a vegan that doesn't eat a whole lot of seaweed, I think it is a good idea to supplement your diet with Vitamin B12-supplements. Normally, your body contains a big reserve of Vitamin B12, that lasts longer than a year after you stop absorbing new Vitamin B12, so don't worry if you didn't think of it from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About your other question: I think Vitamin B12 is the only nutrient that is almost only present in animal products, but I'm not entirely sure of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5862" LastEditorUserId="60" LastEditDate="2022-11-15T12:19:08.257" LastActivityDate="2022-11-15T12:19:08.257" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

As the new year is coming, I'm wondering if I have any tools to help me stop consuming animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After my experiment with veganism (where I nearly died), I learned that I'm genetically anemic, and my doctor recommended I eat fortified foods with iron and I take a B-12 and B-complex every day. Unfortunately, I also learned after an allergy screening due to my weakened position after the vegan/vegetarian diet that I am allergic to soy bean, soy lecithin, most beans, and walnuts (I had to change the brand of b-complex I use as a result that doesn't contain soy). Due to cross contamination, I've pretty much had to eliminate all nuts in my diet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a result of all of this, I mostly eat free range chicken, eggs (actually, my sister has chickens and I get them from her), and fish (not free range) as sources of protein. However, I also occasionally eat beef now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My wife is also severely anemic (we found out during her pregnancy) and just gave birth to our little baby boy five weeks early. Now as we're waiting in the NICU, I'm wondering if my diet may be unsustainable in the future as this little guy (our first child) will need a heavy dairy and meat diet.

In Europe these include Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Poland, and Greece.

Basic economics tells us the market adapts to consumer demands by adjusting prices and reallocating resources, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/supply-and-demand/Market-equilibrium-or-balance-between-supply-and-demand&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;check price theory&lt;/a&gt;. If no one eats meat, vast resources will be freed up (think e.g. land for animal food). Prices signal producers to produce what is demanded. If everyone went vegan/vegetarian at once it will indeed be a shock, reflected in high demand for the vegetarian products available (plus the ones readily produced), leading to a raise in their prices. Producers/entrepreneurs will then have an incentive to make a profit, and reallocate resources to create vegetarian products, lowering prices. Part of the profits will be spent in innovation to make vegetarian products even easier to produce.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These economic tenets govern our everyday life. This is an utopian scenario, since it is impossible for everyone to become vegetarian at once. It happens gradually, if it happens, and markets adjust smoothly.&#xA;Predicting what will happen if everyone went vegetarian is impossible. There is no way for economics to predict how markets/producers adapt to changes in consumer behavior. If everyone went vegetarian, some will still eat eggs, possibly even more than they eat now. Others will choose to consume more milk, while others may go for extra lentils or soy. Individual behavior is impossible to predict. This forms part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;economic calculation problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My answer applies to each and every other consumer behavior change. Such changes cannot affect the global economic system, other than rare (theoretical) cases. This does not mean that certain markets/businesses will be unaffected. Should we suppose that in one region of the globe it is now very easy to make product A, but not product B (which is a substitute of A, another food for example). Suddenly, everyone on the globe wants to buy product B instead of A. The demand for product B will be high in that region, and, if no obstacles exist, people from the region will have an incentive to import the product (while others will want to export it, since there the price may be higher). Indeed, the persons in the region will pay the price for this drastic food change (perhaps longer working hours, cutting traveling etc.). But in no way a global economic collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Such a 'collapse' may be possible if everyone switches to, let's say, heating homes ONLY with kerosene (they will freeze instead of burning wood or gas).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even then, producers of wood, gas, diesel, petrol, electricity will quickly start producing kerosene (and innovating), albeit the shock will affect people. But when we discuss about vegetarian food (many options here), there is no point in discussing any collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, markets adjust surprisingly. Check your local food store. You get a wide variety of foods from all over the globe, at reasonable prices, with little wasted food. If everyone went vegetarian some may actually suffer on the short term (while trying to afford the food) but clearly not on the long term. Trying to compute how much is saved (or lost) from this switch is economic nonsense, since we can't predict how markets will adjust, what are individual preferences, and how producers will innovate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user5940" LastActivityDate="2022-12-24T17:30:05.423" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Also, important, intake deficiency does not translate into serum level deficiency. A balanced vegan diet (beans, grains, legumes) should not be lacking any essential amino acids. An unbalanced one (e.g. grain-based) could be lacking in lysine (perhaps methionine, in special cases, e.g. no soy intake), so I would bet on lysine for 'the most likely deficient amino acid in vegan diets'.

Each cat is unique and will respond differently to different recipes or styles.

Vitamin C is also needed to make collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's really important to get all our needed vitamins and minerals. [1] We get energy from food. A lot of that energy comes from electron transfer. [2] How does that work? Well electron transfer generates heat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Electricity is a form of fire. This is why we call a firewall a firewall.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can use the heat generated by electron transfer to raise the temperature of a chemical reaction, and thereby increase the rate of the reaction and the yield of the reaction. (Consider the relationship between the temperature of a chemical reaction and the rate and yield of the reaction.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also use the chemicals in food as building blocks for protein, DNA, fats, and other molecules needed to make cells. We need a lot of protein to make new cells. Just think: we need protein to make DNA, and we have to replicate our DNA in order to create new cells. [3]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So getting enough vitamin C is one way of improving the absorption of iron. It also helps our immune system. We oxidize vitamin C to get energy. Oxygen is an electron acceptor. Oxygen accepts electrons from vitamin C. [4] We use the heat generated by electron transfer to break down molecules and substances. Our immune system specializes in breaking down substances that need to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The energy we get from vitamin C helps us break down substances that the immune system wants to remove. These substances are broken down in a chemical reaction, and the energy from vitamin C increases the rate of the reaction. The energy from vitamin C can also start a reaction that requires a high initial temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way of improving the absorption of iron is having a healthy and ethical diet. [5] A healthy and ethical diet improves the absorption of vitamins and minerals and other nutrients. A healthy and ethical lifestyle improves the absorption of vitamins and minerals and other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am a vegan and I try my best to have an ethical diet. An ethical diet consists of foods and drinks that are produced without hurting any plants, animals, or other forms of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps. To summarize, two ways of improving iron absorption are getting enough vitamin C and having a healthy and ethical diet and lifestyle. A third way of improving iron absorption is to prevent stress, remove stress, or cure feelings of stress. Stress actually affects the concentration of hormones in the bloodstream, by adding stress hormones to the bloodstream. Our digestion is connected to the hormones in the bloodstream, and the concentration of those hormones. The healthier our hormones, the easier it is to digest. [6]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] Vitamins A, B12, C, D, E, and K are some examples of vitamins. Iron, calcium and potassium are some examples of minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[2] We actually have many ways of getting energy from food. One way is by oxidizing an electron donor, like glucose or vitamin C. Oxygen is an electron acceptor. Oxygen can accept electrons from glucose and vitamin C, and this electron transfer generates a lot of energy in the form of heat. Another way of getting energy from food is by breaking molecular bonds. In the process called glycolysis, we oxidize glucose, and we also break chemical bonds in glucose. The glucose molecule is capable of holding more energy when it is fully intact. After one of its molecular bonds is broken, the glucose molecule is capable of holding less energy. The energy that gets released is released in the form of heat. So that is a second way of getting energy from the molecules in food. There is a third way of getting energy from the molecules in food. When we eat or drink electrolytes, we are able to create ions from the electrolytes. Electrolytes are sources of ions. Calcium carbonate is a source of calcium ions. We can get Ca2+ ions from calcium carbonate. We can get calcium ions and potassium ions from foods containing calcium and potassium. We can get K+ ions from food containing potassium. These ions are capable of creating a voltage difference. These ions have electric potential energy. So we can get electric potential energy from ions. We can get energy from ions in the form of electric potential. When you put Ca2+ ions or K+ ions in the axon of a neuron, it creates a voltage difference with the outside of the cell membrane. This voltage difference is sometimes called a membrane potential. We need Ca2+ ions and K+ ions in order to release action potentials in our neurons. We need calcium and potassium in order to release action potentials in our brains and in our muscles and in our nervous tissues. So calcium and potassium are important for brain function and muscle function. To summarize this footnote, we have discussed three ways of getting energy from food. One way is by oxidizing an electron donor, like glucose or vitamin C. One way is by breaking molecular bonds. We break molecular bonds in glucose during the process of glycolysis. We also oxidize glucose during the process of glycolysis. A third way of getting energy from food is by creating ions out of electrolytes. When you put an electrolyte in water it dissolves and forms ions. That's one reason we need water. Water is a solvent. It is super important to be hydrated and drink enough water. Two forms of hydration are drinking water and showering. I want to add that electrolytes are super important. A lot of people have a calcium deficiency or a potassium deficiency. The US government creates fortified drinks that have calcium and other essential vitamins and minerals. The US government sells these fortified drinks in grocery stores. It is important to know what foods and drinks are safe for your unique and individual biology. It is important to have safe food, safe drink, and safe air. A food that is safe for one person might not be safe for another person, and one example is a food that generates an allergic reaction in a population of people. So we can really figure out what foods and drinks are safe for us, and get dietary sources of all the vitamins and minerals we need. We can figure out what foods and drinks are safe for us, and get dietary sources of electrolytes. We can figure out what foods and drinks are safe for us, and get dietary sources of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, fiber, and water. Fiber helps us digest. Fiber is super important. I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[3] We need protein in order to get the nucleic acids that are needed to make new DNA. We also need protein in order to get the amino acids that are needed to make new proteins in the ribosome. We need to get enough protein in our diet to make new cells and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[4] Oxygen is an electron acceptor and vitamin C is an electron donor. Glucose is also an electron donor. We oxidize vitamin C to get energy from vitamin C. When we oxidize vitamin C, oxygen accepts electrons from vitamin C. We oxidize glucose to get energy from glucose. When we oxidize glucose, oxygen accepts electrons from glucose. We oxidize glucose in a process called glycolysis, which is part of cellular respiration. The electron transfer that occurs during the process of oxidation generates heat, and we use that heat to power chemical reactions and to make ourselves warm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[5] Eating too much makes it harder to digest, and eating too little makes it harder to digest. An unhealthy diet makes it harder to digest. So it makes sense that a healthy and ethical diet makes it easier to digest food and absorb iron. It's important to get enough iron and to find ethical foods that are rich in iron. The website nutrition.gov gives dietary sources for iron and other minerals. The website nutrition.gov gives dietary sources for all of the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that we need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[6] Diet and stress are two risk factors for disease, and this is an adage in medicine. A risk factor is a factor that increases or decreases a risk. An unhealthy diet increases the risk of disease. Stress increases the risk of disease. A healthy diet decreases the risk of disease. When we cure feelings of stress we decrease the risk of disease. And the reason for this is: when we cure stress we improve the health of our blood. This topic, blood health, is important. We don't want to have too much stress in our blood and we don't want to have too much sugar in our blood. Everyone can have perfect blood health if they have a correct diet, receive competent medical care, and take all of the medicines that they need to take. Medicine is extremely important, and the field of medicine is a fascinating field. The US government is so advanced that the US government has already cured every disease, by means of medicine. For every disease there is a cure. We can use medicine to cure any disease. Medicine is one of the best creations in the history of planet Earth and in the history of the universe. In order to cure many diseases, illnesses, and health problems, we need to take medicine every day, and that routine of taking medicine every day is the cure. A lot of people say, &amp;quot;It's only a disease if it's left untreated.&amp;quot; And we treat it with medicine, taking medicine as often as we need to take medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6109" LastEditorUserId="6109" LastEditDate="2023-12-07T23:45:12.833" LastActivityDate="2023-12-07T23:45:12.833" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

A worker spends 40 hours making cardboard boxes in return for 40 hours of other different people growing lettuce and working to refine petroleum into gasoline, etc...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you asked whether or not the economy would collapse when and if the people of the world stopped eating meat, it sounded like you thought the economy was more than mere record keeping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose that you write down how many carrots you have inside of your refrigerator. Every time you buy groceries, you add a number to the previous total. Every time you eat a carrot, subtract a number from the previous total.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, your record of carrots might be incorrect. Maybe 10 carrots are inside of your refrigerator instead of 19 carrots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Money won't make potatoes available. The number of potatoes is determined by the number of potatoes which farmers grow. If no person is willing to grow potatoes, but everyone is a multi-millionaire, then there will be no potatoes to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So.... if the record keeping (the economy) falls apart, the number of automobiles, houses, laptop computers, tomatoes, ears of corn, bathroom toilets, etc... remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want the standard of living to remain high you have to have most people working.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Will the economy collapse? Maybe yes a day maybe no. The real question is, will people continue to make goods and offer services? In the event of economic collapse, would taxi drivers still drive people to the airport? Would petroleum refinery workers keep working ? Would electricians put wires inside of halfway built houses? Would computer programmers continue to maintain Google email services?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6161" LastEditorUserId="60" LastEditDate="2023-04-22T14:53:23.390" LastActivityDate="2023-04-22T14:53:23.390" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Not all people want to be healthy all the time, and this is a treat that would best be enjoyed in moderation. So if you're a health nut, you should limit the beef burger and the mock burger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, such mock-burgers are not the only vegan option for putting on the grill. Here are some whole food burger recipes for the grill you could try:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Portabello Burger: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.veggiesdontbite.com/vegan-grilled-portobello-mushroom-burgers/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.veggiesdontbite.com/vegan-grilled-portobello-mushroom-burgers/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Walnut Chickpea Burger: &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovingitvegan.com/vegan-burger/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://lovingitvegan.com/vegan-burger/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Seitan Burger: &lt;a href=&quot;https://thecheekychickpea.com/best-vegan-burger-recipe/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://thecheekychickpea.com/best-vegan-burger-recipe/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mushroom Lentil Burger: &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebananadiaries.com/easy-veggie-mushroom-lentil-burgers/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://thebananadiaries.com/easy-veggie-mushroom-lentil-burgers/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Black Bean Burger: &lt;a href=&quot;https://veganheaven.org/recipe/black-bean-patties-vegan-grillable/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://veganheaven.org/recipe/black-bean-patties-vegan-grillable/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Artichoke Spinach Cauliflower Bean Burger: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.veganricha.com/artichoke-spinach-cauliflower-bean/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.veganricha.com/artichoke-spinach-cauliflower-bean/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/39JB4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/39JB4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Seitan burger&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;image from- &lt;a href=&quot;https://thecheekychickpea.com/best-vegan-burger-recipe/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://thecheekychickpea.com/best-vegan-burger-recipe/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Is processed always bad?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We try to avoid processed food and food with questionable ingredients like soy, (hydrogenated) seed oils, processed sugar, emulsifiers, gums, preservatives, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Canola oil is a subject of concern due to the possibility of containing trans-fats, which are associated with significant health issues. However, it is important to note that canola oil contains very low levels of trans-fat. To provide a comparison, the fat of cattle, sheep, and cow's milk naturally contain around &lt;em&gt;2-5% of trans-fat as a percentage of the total fat&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/FV8sq.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/FV8sq.png&quot; alt=&quot;table transfats&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Canola oil is a safe and healthy form of fat that will reduce blood LDL cholesterol levels and heart disease risk compared to carbohydrates or saturated fats such as found in beef tallow or butter.  Indeed, in a randomized trial that showed one of the most striking reductions in risk of heart disease, canola oil was used as the primary form of fat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2015/04/13/ask-the-expert-concerns-about-canola-oil/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2015/04/13/ask-the-expert-concerns-about-canola-oil/&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwr7uQaVHzg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwr7uQaVHzg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fears relating to seed oils are likely overblown.

If possible, shake them out over an area where plants are growing so the insects will have a new home and the fertile dirt can go to good use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While shaking the greens out, gently separate the leaves a little (without breaking them from the stalk) to let trapped dirt fall away.  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep the plants as intact as possible until you are ready to eat them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hold off on washing anything until you are ready to eat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you are ready to eat, fill a small bowl with water.

You'll be able to use the same small bowl to rinse all the greens for your meal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Experiment to find the right shape of bowl for the job.

There are those who claim that it's impossible or unhealthy for dogs to eat only vegetarian food, but presumably this company wouldn't have survived for two decades selling vegetarian complete dog food if that were the case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source 2: personal experience. I had a dog who was (like myself) a lifelong vegetarian. She lived primarily on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.petplanet.co.uk/p26043/wafcol_vegetarian.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wafcol vegetarian complete dog food&lt;/a&gt;, with of course other things to make her diet more interesting, such as vegetables and non-meat protein sources. She lived to a ripe old age (for a dog) and never had diet-related health problems as far as I know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, it all comes down to a question of what essential nutrients (amino acids and so on) a given species requires. If you want to be sure, list them and figure out what vegetarian foods can act as sources for each of those nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Disclaimer: I don't know if it's possible for a dog to be &lt;em&gt;vegan&lt;/em&gt;, and I've heard that it's impossible for a cat to be vegetarian or vegan. So this answer doesn't cover all possible pet/diet combinations, but you mentioned that you're vegetarian (not vegan) and you mentioned dogs as well as cats, so I hope this answer can be helpful for you.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bva.co.uk/news-and-blog/blog-article/is-it-safe-to-feed-my-dog-a-plant-based-diet-hold-the-greens-only-meals-why-the-jury-is-still-out-on-vegan-dog-diets/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;British Veterinary Association&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer is more complex and more nuanced than TV debates or discussions allow for. From the veterinary profession’s perspective, there just isn’t enough scientific evidence currently to safely promote a vegan diet for dogs and cats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[...] Dogs are omnivores, which means that they eat both meat and plant products. While it is theoretically possible, the British Veterinary Association does not recommend giving a dog a vegetarian or a vegan diet as it is much easier to get the balance of essential nutrients wrong than to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cats are obligate carnivores, which means it is much harder or even impossible to meet their nutritional needs without feeding them meat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This strikes me as a carefully worded text, presumably to avoid the possibility of being sued as well as of saying anything wrong. They &lt;em&gt;do not recommend&lt;/em&gt; vegetarian or vegan diets for dogs, but only because it's &lt;em&gt;difficult&lt;/em&gt;, acknowledging that it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;. (Presumably, a vegetarian diet would be easier than a vegan diet.)

After we transitioned them, they became noticeably healthier. We did the transition slowly over the year. At first we only mixed a teaspoon into their store-bought food with dead animals in it. We increased it slowly until we were only mixing-in a teaspoon of the dead animal food into the vegan food. Finally, we just stopped buying the dead animals alltogether.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you make the cat food yourself and only buy the additives, it's extremely cheap.

The next day we'll cook them with the broccoli until soft, then add the oats and cook for another half-hour. Then we throw it in a blender with the oil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We cook in large batches and freeze them. Also our cats are older; you may want to use more protein (lentils) if you have a younger or more active cat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just before feeding, we mix-in the additives (VegeCat, VegeYeast, Enzyme Miracle -- all bought from &lt;a href=&quot;https://compassioncircle.com/shop/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Compassion Circle&lt;/a&gt;).

The breeders live with the roosters, and the rest make eggs and forage until they die. If they're needed for food, they are killed calmly and painlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The world supply chain is rife with cheap products produced by poor people, mistreated people, coerced workers, children and even outright slaves.
